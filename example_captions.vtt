<v MR. REID>Mr. President, we're doing our

00:04:26 --> 00:04:27
<v MR. REID>utmost to work through the

00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
<v MR. REID>matters that we still have to do

93
00:04:29 --> 00:04:32
<v MR. REID>here in the senate.

94
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
<v MR. REID>We have pending now a cloture

95
00:04:34 --> 00:04:35
<v MR. REID>motion on the surface

97
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
<v MR. REID>That time will ripen tomorrow

98
00:04:40 --> 00:04:40
<v MR. REID>morning an hour after we come

99
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
<v MR. REID>in.

100
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
<v MR. REID>Following that, there is a vote

101
00:04:45 --> 00:04:49
<v MR. REID>on a person from new york who

<v MR. REID>scheduled in the house and we

106
00:04:59 --> 00:05:00
<v MR. REID>will do it over here as quickly

107
00:05:00 --> 00:05:02

<v MR. REID>we're going to see if things can

<v MR. REID>that we will be in at least for

111
00:05:07 --> 00:05:08
<v MR. REID>tomorrow.

112
00:05:09 --> 00:05:10
<v MR. REID>I hope we won't be in any longer

113
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
<v MR. REID>than that, but it all depends on

114
00:05:12 --> 00:05:14

00:05:14 --> 00:05:17

<v MR. CARDIN>And let me thank senator wicker

203
00:09:58 --> 00:09:59
<v MR. CARDIN>for starting us off on the

204
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
<v MR. CARDIN>discussion of what's happening

205
00:10:01 --> 00:10:03
<v MR. CARDIN>in russia today.

206
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
<v MR. CARDIN>I rise today along with some of

207
00:10:05 --> 00:10:06
<v MR. CARDIN>my colleagues to bring attention

208
00:10:06 --> 00:10:08
<v MR. CARDIN>to the growing issue of human

209
00:10:08 --> 00:10:12
<v MR. CARDIN>rights violations in russia.

210
00:10:12 --> 00:10:13
<v MR. CARDIN>Typified by the case of sergay

211
00:10:13 --> 00:10:15
<v MR. CARDIN>magnitsky.

212
00:10:15 --> 00:10:16
<v MR. CARDIN>Just last week as part of a

213
00:10:16 --> 00:10:16
<v MR. CARDIN>bilateral presidential

214
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
<v MR. CARDIN>commission, attorney general

215
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
<v MR. CARDIN>holder met with russian minister

216
00:10:21 --> 00:10:22
<v MR. CARDIN>of justice to discuss the rule

217
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24
<v MR. CARDIN>of law issues.

218
00:10:24 --> 00:10:26
<v MR. CARDIN>That same week, russian

219
00:10:26 --> 00:10:30
<v MR. CARDIN>officials moved in their

220
00:10:30 --> 00:10:30
<v MR. CARDIN>criminal prosecution of sergei

221
00:10:30 --> 00:10:33
<v MR. CARDIN>magnitsky.

222
00:10:33 --> 00:10:34
<v MR. CARDIN>Mr. President, I remind you that

223
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
<v MR. CARDIN>Mr. Magnitsky has been dead for

224
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
<v MR. CARDIN>more than two years.

225
00:10:39 --> 00:10:41
<v MR. CARDIN>Last May, I joined with senator

226
00:10:41 --> 00:10:43
<v MR. CARDIN>Mccain and senator wicker and

227
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
<v MR. CARDIN>11 other of our senators from

228
00:10:46 --> 00:10:48
<v MR. CARDIN>both parties to introduce the

229
00:10:48 --> 00:10:49
<v MR. CARDIN>sergei magnitsky rule of law

230
00:10:49 --> 00:10:51
<v MR. CARDIN>accountability act.

231
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
<v MR. CARDIN>We now have nearly 30

232
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
<v MR. CARDIN>cosponsors, and I urge more to

233
00:10:55 --> 00:10:56
<v MR. CARDIN>join us and look at ways to move

234
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
<v MR. CARDIN>forward on helping halt abuses

235
00:10:58 --> 00:11:00
<v MR. CARDIN>like this in the future.

236
00:11:00 --> 00:11:03
<v MR. CARDIN>After exposing the largest known

237
00:11:03 --> 00:11:06
<v MR. CARDIN>tax fraud in russian history,

238
00:11:06 --> 00:11:07
<v MR. CARDIN>sergei magnitsky, a russian tax

239
00:11:07 --> 00:11:09
<v MR. CARDIN>lawyer, working for an american

240
00:11:09 --> 00:11:10
<v MR. CARDIN>firm in moscow, was falsely

241
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
<v MR. CARDIN>arrested for crimes he did not

242
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
<v MR. CARDIN>commit and tortured in prison.

243
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
<v MR. CARDIN>Six months later, he became

244
00:11:16 --> 00:11:18
<v MR. CARDIN>seriously ill and was

245
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
<v MR. CARDIN>consistently denied medical

246
00:11:20 --> 00:11:20
<v MR. CARDIN>attention despite 20 former

247
00:11:20 --> 00:11:23
<v MR. CARDIN>requests.

248
00:11:23 --> 00:11:26
<v MR. CARDIN>And then on the night of

249
00:11:26 --> 00:11:27
<v MR. CARDIN>November 16, 2009, he went into

250
00:11:27 --> 00:11:28
<v MR. CARDIN>critical condition, but instead

251
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
<v MR. CARDIN>of being treated in a hospital,

252
00:11:31 --> 00:11:33
<v MR. CARDIN>he was put in an isolation cell,

253
00:11:34 --> 00:11:35
<v MR. CARDIN>chained to a bed, beaten by

254
00:11:35 --> 00:11:37
<v MR. CARDIN>eight prison guards with rubber

255
00:11:37 --> 00:11:41
<v MR. CARDIN>batons for one hour and 18

256
00:11:41 --> 00:11:43
<v MR. CARDIN>minutes until he was dead.

257
00:11:43 --> 00:11:45
<v MR. CARDIN>Sergei magnitsky was 37 years

258
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47
<v MR. CARDIN>old, left behind a wife, two

259
00:11:47 --> 00:11:49
<v MR. CARDIN>children and a dependent mother.

260
00:11:49 --> 00:11:50
<v MR. CARDIN>While the facts around his

261
00:11:50 --> 00:11:53
<v MR. CARDIN>arrest, detention and death has

262
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
<v MR. CARDIN>been independently verified and

263
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
<v MR. CARDIN>accepted at the highest levels

264
00:11:57 --> 00:11:58
<v MR. CARDIN>of russian government, those

265
00:11:58 --> 00:12:02
<v MR. CARDIN>implicated in his death and the

266
00:12:02 --> 00:12:03
<v MR. CARDIN>corruption he exposed remain

267
00:12:03 --> 00:12:06
<v MR. CARDIN>unpunished, in positions of

268
00:12:06 --> 00:12:09
<v MR. CARDIN>authority, and some have even

269
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
<v MR. CARDIN>been decorated and promoted.

270
00:12:11 --> 00:12:12
<v MR. CARDIN>Following magnitsky's death,

271
00:12:12 --> 00:12:13
<v MR. CARDIN>they have continued to target

272
00:12:13 --> 00:12:15
<v MR. CARDIN>others, including american

273
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17
<v MR. CARDIN>business interests in moscow.

274
00:12:17 --> 00:12:18
<v MR. CARDIN>These officials have been

275
00:12:18 --> 00:12:20
<v MR. CARDIN>credibly linked to similar

276
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
<v MR. CARDIN>crimes and have ties to russian

277
00:12:22 --> 00:12:24
<v MR. CARDIN>mafia, international arms

278
00:12:24 --> 00:12:24
<v MR. CARDIN>trafficking and even drug

279
00:12:24 --> 00:12:26
<v MR. CARDIN>cartels.

280
00:12:26 --> 00:12:27
<v MR. CARDIN>The money they stole from the

281
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
<v MR. CARDIN>russian budget was bartered

282
00:12:29 --> 00:12:30
<v MR. CARDIN>through a network of banks

283
00:12:30 --> 00:12:30
<v MR. CARDIN>including two in the united

284
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
<v MR. CARDIN>states.

285
00:12:32 --> 00:12:36
<v MR. CARDIN>Calls for investigation have

286
00:12:36 --> 00:12:39
<v MR. CARDIN>fallen on deaf ears, an -- and

287
00:12:39 --> 00:12:41
<v MR. CARDIN>in a turn of events, law

288
00:12:41 --> 00:12:42
<v MR. CARDIN>enforcement officers accused by

289
00:12:42 --> 00:12:47
<v MR. CARDIN>magnitsky and those most

290
00:12:47 --> 00:12:50
<v MR. CARDIN>involved in his murder are --

291
00:12:50 --> 00:12:51
<v MR. CARDIN>and those that are accused by

292
00:12:51 --> 00:12:52
<v MR. CARDIN>magnitsky and those most

293
00:12:52 --> 00:12:54
<v MR. CARDIN>complicit in his murder are

294
00:12:54 --> 00:12:55
<v MR. CARDIN>moving to try him for the very

295
00:12:55 --> 00:12:56
<v MR. CARDIN>tax crimes they committed.

296
00:12:56 --> 00:13:00
<v MR. CARDIN>Think of the irony here.

297
00:13:00 --> 00:13:03
<v MR. CARDIN>He exposed corruption in russia.

298
00:13:03 --> 00:13:06
<v MR. CARDIN>As a result, he was arrested,

299
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
<v MR. CARDIN>imprisoned, tortured and killed.

300
00:13:08 --> 00:13:12
<v MR. CARDIN>now, those who perpetrated the

301
00:13:12 --> 00:13:14
<v MR. CARDIN>crime on him are charging him

302
00:13:14 --> 00:13:16
<v MR. CARDIN>after his death with the crimes

303
00:13:16 --> 00:13:20
<v MR. CARDIN>they committed.

304
00:13:20 --> 00:13:22
<v MR. CARDIN>We cannot be silent.

305
00:13:22 --> 00:13:23
<v MR. CARDIN>One of the most articulate

306
00:13:23 --> 00:13:24
<v MR. CARDIN>voices in the united states

307
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
<v MR. CARDIN>senate on this issue has been

308
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
<v MR. CARDIN>senator wicker, who is the

309
00:13:28 --> 00:13:29
<v MR. CARDIN>leading republican on the

310
00:13:29 --> 00:13:31
<v MR. CARDIN>helsinki commission, and I

311
00:13:31 --> 00:13:33
<v MR. CARDIN>applaud him for his efforts, not

312
00:13:33 --> 00:13:36
<v MR. CARDIN>only on bringing the magnitsky

313
00:13:36 --> 00:13:37
<v MR. CARDIN>abuse to public attention and

314
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
<v MR. CARDIN>what's happening in russia, but

315
00:13:40 --> 00:13:42
<v MR. CARDIN>in many other areas where human

316
00:13:42 --> 00:13:44
<v MR. CARDIN>rights violations have occurred.

317
00:13:44 --> 00:13:46
<v MR. CARDIN>I would be glad to allow my

318
00:13:46 --> 00:13:47
<v MR. CARDIN>colleagues some time on this

319
00:13:47 --> 00:13:48
<v MR. CARDIN>issue.

320
00:13:49 --> 00:13:50
<v MR. WICKER>well, I thank my

321
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
<v MR. WICKER>colleague from maryland.

322
00:13:52 --> 00:13:55
<v MR. WICKER>Yes, indeed, there are other

323
00:13:55 --> 00:13:56
<v MR. WICKER>cases of human rights

324
00:13:56 --> 00:14:00
<v MR. WICKER>violations, not the least of

325
00:14:00 --> 00:14:04
<v MR. WICKER>which I have highlighted time

326
00:14:04 --> 00:14:13
<v MR. WICKER>and again on this senate floor,

327
00:14:13 --> 00:14:20
<v MR. WICKER>being the cases of mikhail

328
00:14:20 --> 00:14:21
<v MR. WICKER>khodorkovsky and lesbian bed he --

329
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
<v MR. WICKER>lebedev.

330
00:14:23 --> 00:14:24
<v MR. WICKER>The story about corruption

331
00:14:24 --> 00:14:24
<v MR. WICKER>within the russian government

332
00:14:24 --> 00:14:25
<v MR. WICKER>itself.

333
00:14:25 --> 00:14:26
<v MR. WICKER>My colleagues and I will

334
00:14:26 --> 00:14:28
<v MR. WICKER>continue to speak out about

335
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
<v MR. WICKER>these cases in the hope that

336
00:14:31 --> 00:14:33
<v MR. WICKER>attention will inspire change.

337
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
<v MR. WICKER>I look forward to the day when a

338
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
<v MR. WICKER>focus of a floor statement can

339
00:14:37 --> 00:14:38
<v MR. WICKER>be about the progress we have

340
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
<v MR. WICKER>made with russia.

341
00:14:40 --> 00:14:41
<v MR. WICKER>It's something my colleague and

342
00:14:41 --> 00:14:43
<v MR. WICKER>I dearly look forward to.

343
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
<v MR. WICKER>We look for the day when russia

344
00:14:45 --> 00:14:46
<v MR. WICKER>begins to uphold democracy,

345
00:14:46 --> 00:14:47
<v MR. WICKER>human rights and the rule of

346
00:14:47 --> 00:14:49
<v MR. WICKER>law, but unfortunately today is

347
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
<v MR. WICKER>not the day.

348
00:14:51 --> 00:14:52
<v MR. WICKER>In recent months, an

349
00:14:52 --> 00:14:57
<v MR. WICKER>overwhelming number of headlines

350
00:14:57 --> 00:14:59
<v MR. WICKER>out of russia focus on the

351
00:14:59 --> 00:15:00
<v MR. WICKER>russian spring.

352
00:15:00 --> 00:15:01
<v MR. WICKER>Opposition groups, citizens and

353
00:15:01 --> 00:15:03
<v MR. WICKER>in many cases the mainstream

354
00:15:03 --> 00:15:05
<v MR. WICKER>media have reacted to moves by

355
00:15:05 --> 00:15:06
<v MR. WICKER>the russian regime they view as

356
00:15:06 --> 00:15:09
<v MR. WICKER>no longer acceptable.

357
00:15:09 --> 00:15:13
<v MR. WICKER>on September 24 of last year,

358
00:15:13 --> 00:15:16
<v MR. WICKER>President Medvedev struck a deal

359
00:15:16 --> 00:15:17
<v MR. WICKER>that would clear the way for his

360
00:15:17 --> 00:15:19
<v MR. WICKER>predecessor, vladimir putin, to

361
00:15:19 --> 00:15:20
<v MR. WICKER>run next month for a third

362
00:15:20 --> 00:15:21
<v MR. WICKER>presidential term.

363
00:15:21 --> 00:15:23
<v MR. WICKER>As the &quot;wall street journal&quot;

364
00:15:23 --> 00:15:25
<v MR. WICKER>noted in an opinion piece last

365
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
<v MR. WICKER>December, even the most

366
00:15:27 --> 00:15:30
<v MR. WICKER>thick-skinned citizens saw that

367
00:15:30 --> 00:15:31
<v MR. WICKER>turning the presidency into the

368
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
<v MR. WICKER>object of a private swap and

369
00:15:33 --> 00:15:34
<v MR. WICKER>made a mockery of the

370
00:15:34 --> 00:15:36
<v MR. WICKER>constitution.

371
00:15:36 --> 00:15:37
<v MR. WICKER>Russia's fraudulent

372
00:15:37 --> 00:15:39
<v MR. WICKER>parliamentary elections in

373
00:15:39 --> 00:15:40
<v MR. WICKER>December further deepened the

374
00:15:40 --> 00:15:43
<v MR. WICKER>political crisis and affirmed

375
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
<v MR. WICKER>the erosion of democracy.

376
00:15:45 --> 00:15:47
<v MR. WICKER>Secretary clinton, our secretary

377
00:15:47 --> 00:15:48
<v MR. WICKER>of state, called them neither

378
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
<v MR. WICKER>free nor fair.

379
00:15:52 --> 00:15:54
<v MR. WICKER>so this is a bipartisan

380
00:15:54 --> 00:15:56
<v MR. WICKER>denunciation of the process.

381
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
<v MR. WICKER>Observers have claimed that 12%

382
00:15:58 --> 00:16:00
<v MR. WICKER>to 15% of the votes were

383
00:16:00 --> 00:16:00
<v MR. WICKER>falsified in favor of the united

384
00:16:00 --> 00:16:03
<v MR. WICKER>russia party.

385
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
<v MR. WICKER>According to most analysts,

386
00:16:05 --> 00:16:07
<v MR. WICKER>improvement is not expected in

387
00:16:07 --> 00:16:11
<v MR. WICKER>the upcoming presidential

388
00:16:11 --> 00:16:12
<v MR. WICKER>election this March.

389
00:16:12 --> 00:16:13
<v MR. WICKER>But these corrupt actions have

390
00:16:13 --> 00:16:16
<v MR. WICKER>not been ignored.

391
00:16:16 --> 00:16:16
<v MR. WICKER>On December 10, more than

392
00:16:16 --> 00:16:19
<v MR. WICKER>60,000 russians took to the

393
00:16:19 --> 00:16:24
<v MR. WICKER>streets of moscow in protest.

394
00:16:24 --> 00:16:28
<v MR. WICKER>Similarly on February, some

395
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
<v MR. WICKER>120,000 citizens braved below

396
00:16:31 --> 00:16:33
<v MR. WICKER>zero weather in central moscow.

397
00:16:33 --> 00:16:40
<v MR. WICKER>Their demands were clear:

398
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
<v MR. WICKER>release political prisoners like

399
00:16:43 --> 00:16:45
<v MR. WICKER>hotokovski and lebedev.

400
00:16:45 --> 00:16:45
<v MR. WICKER>Allow opposition parties to

401
00:16:45 --> 00:16:48
<v MR. WICKER>register.

402
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
<v MR. WICKER>Pledge not to give a single vote

403
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
<v MR. WICKER>to putin on March 4.

404
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
<v MR. WICKER>similar rallies were held

405
00:16:54 --> 00:16:54
<v MR. WICKER>across -- in small towns across

406
00:16:54 --> 00:16:57
<v MR. WICKER>russia.

407
00:16:57 --> 00:16:59
<v MR. WICKER>We can be glad for the call for

408
00:16:59 --> 00:17:00
<v MR. WICKER>reform, and we're glad that

409
00:17:00 --> 00:17:03
<v MR. WICKER>it's growing louder.

410
00:17:03 --> 00:17:06
<v MR. WICKER>According to a February poll by

411
00:17:06 --> 00:17:08
<v MR. WICKER>russia's independent lavata

412
00:17:08 --> 00:17:11
<v MR. WICKER>center, 43% of russians now

413
00:17:11 --> 00:17:12
<v MR. WICKER>support pro-democracy protests.

414
00:17:12 --> 00:17:15
<v MR. WICKER>additional protests are already

415
00:17:15 --> 00:17:20
<v MR. WICKER>scheduled for later this month.

416
00:17:20 --> 00:17:24
<v MR. WICKER>Now, specifically let me once

417
00:17:24 --> 00:17:27
<v MR. WICKER>again underscore the horrific

418
00:17:27 --> 00:17:29
<v MR. WICKER>facts about sergei magnitsky

419
00:17:29 --> 00:17:31
<v MR. WICKER>because it needs to be heard and

420
00:17:31 --> 00:17:33
<v MR. WICKER>perhaps some of our colleagues

421
00:17:33 --> 00:17:35
<v MR. WICKER>were not listening the first

422
00:17:35 --> 00:17:37
<v MR. WICKER>time.

423
00:17:37 --> 00:17:39
<v MR. WICKER>In the midst of this public

424
00:17:39 --> 00:17:41
<v MR. WICKER>outcry and demand for democratic

425
00:17:41 --> 00:17:43
<v MR. WICKER>process, the news out of russia

426
00:17:43 --> 00:17:44
<v MR. WICKER>with regard to Mr. Magnitsky is

427
00:17:44 --> 00:17:46
<v MR. WICKER>almost unbelievable.

428
00:17:46 --> 00:17:48
<v MR. WICKER>Just last week it was revealed

429
00:17:48 --> 00:17:50
<v MR. WICKER>that the police in russia plan

430
00:17:50 --> 00:17:52
<v MR. WICKER>to retry the tax evasion case of

431
00:17:52 --> 00:17:54
<v MR. WICKER>the late sergei magnitsky.

432
00:17:54 --> 00:17:57
<v MR. WICKER>as many of my colleagues are

433
00:17:57 --> 00:17:57
<v MR. WICKER>aware, Mr. Magnitsky is already

434
00:17:57 --> 00:17:59
<v MR. WICKER>dead.

435
00:17:59 --> 00:18:00
<v MR. WICKER>He died in russian detention

436
00:18:00 --> 00:18:03
<v MR. WICKER>more than two years ago.

437
00:18:03 --> 00:18:06
<v MR. WICKER>He was a lawyer and a partner in

438
00:18:06 --> 00:18:07
<v MR. WICKER>an american-owned law firm based

439
00:18:07 --> 00:18:09
<v MR. WICKER>in moscow.

440
00:18:09 --> 00:18:10
<v MR. WICKER>He was married with two

441
00:18:10 --> 00:18:11
<v MR. WICKER>children, as my friend has

442
00:18:11 --> 00:18:13
<v MR. WICKER>said.

443
00:18:13 --> 00:18:15
<v MR. WICKER>His clients included the

444
00:18:15 --> 00:18:19
<v MR. WICKER>hermitage fund, which is the

445
00:18:19 --> 00:18:21
<v MR. WICKER>largest foreign portfolio

446
00:18:21 --> 00:18:22
<v MR. WICKER>investor in russia.

447
00:18:22 --> 00:18:25
<v MR. WICKER>Through his investigative work

448
00:18:25 --> 00:18:27
<v MR. WICKER>on behalf of hermitage,

449
00:18:27 --> 00:18:30
<v MR. WICKER>Mr. Magnitsky discovered that

450
00:18:30 --> 00:18:33
<v MR. WICKER>russian interior ministry

451
00:18:33 --> 00:18:34
<v MR. WICKER>officers, tax officials, and

452
00:18:34 --> 00:18:38
<v MR. WICKER>organized criminals worked

453
00:18:38 --> 00:18:39
<v MR. WICKER>together to steal $230 million

454
00:18:39 --> 00:18:42
<v MR. WICKER>in public funds, orchestrating

455
00:18:42 --> 00:18:45
<v MR. WICKER>the largest tax rebate fraud in

456
00:18:45 --> 00:18:46
<v MR. WICKER>the history of the russian

457
00:18:46 --> 00:18:49
<v MR. WICKER>republic.

458
00:18:49 --> 00:18:51
<v MR. WICKER>In 2008, Mr. Magnitsky

459
00:18:51 --> 00:18:52
<v MR. WICKER>voluntarily gave sworn testimony

460
00:18:52 --> 00:18:54
<v MR. WICKER>against officials from the

461
00:18:54 --> 00:18:56
<v MR. WICKER>interior ministry, russian tax

462
00:18:56 --> 00:18:57
<v MR. WICKER>departments, and the private

463
00:18:57 --> 00:18:58
<v MR. WICKER>criminals whom he found had had

464
00:18:58 --> 00:19:03
<v MR. WICKER>perpetrated the fraud.

465
00:19:03 --> 00:19:03
<v MR. WICKER>A month later, an arrest was

466
00:19:03 --> 00:19:05
<v MR. WICKER>made.

467
00:19:05 --> 00:19:07
<v MR. WICKER>And the person arrested was

468
00:19:07 --> 00:19:09
<v MR. WICKER>Mr. Magnitsky himself.

469
00:19:09 --> 00:19:11
<v MR. WICKER>He was placed in pretrial

470
00:19:11 --> 00:19:15
<v MR. WICKER>detention and he was held

471
00:19:15 --> 00:19:16
<v MR. WICKER>without trial for 12 months.

472
00:19:16 --> 00:19:18
<v MR. WICKER>while in custody he was

473
00:19:18 --> 00:19:19
<v MR. WICKER>pressured and tortured by

474
00:19:19 --> 00:19:21
<v MR. WICKER>russian officials hoping he

475
00:19:21 --> 00:19:24
<v MR. WICKER>would withdraw his testimony,

476
00:19:24 --> 00:19:25
<v MR. WICKER>and falsely incriminate himself

477
00:19:25 --> 00:19:28
<v MR. WICKER>and his client.

478
00:19:28 --> 00:19:31
<v MR. WICKER>But he refused to do so.

479
00:19:31 --> 00:19:32
<v MR. WICKER>And his conditions worsened and

480
00:19:32 --> 00:19:33
<v MR. WICKER>his health worsened,

481
00:19:33 --> 00:19:36
<v MR. WICKER>Mr. President.

482
00:19:36 --> 00:19:37
<v MR. WICKER>he spent months without medical

483
00:19:37 --> 00:19:39
<v MR. WICKER>care.

484
00:19:39 --> 00:19:42
<v MR. WICKER>Requests for medical examination

485
00:19:42 --> 00:19:44
<v MR. WICKER>and surgery were denied by

486
00:19:44 --> 00:19:48
<v MR. WICKER>russian government officials.

487
00:19:48 --> 00:19:50
<v MR. WICKER>On November 13, 2009,

488
00:19:50 --> 00:19:52
<v MR. WICKER>Mr. Magnitsky's condition

489
00:19:52 --> 00:19:53
<v MR. WICKER>deteriorated dramatically.

490
00:19:53 --> 00:19:55
<v MR. WICKER>Doctors saw him on November 16

491
00:19:55 --> 00:19:57
<v MR. WICKER>when he was transferred to a

492
00:19:57 --> 00:20:00
<v MR. WICKER>moscow detention center that

493
00:20:00 --> 00:20:03
<v MR. WICKER>actually had medical facilities.

494
00:20:03 --> 00:20:04
<v MR. WICKER>Yet instead of being treated at

495
00:20:04 --> 00:20:08
<v MR. WICKER>those facilities immediately,

496
00:20:08 --> 00:20:11
<v MR. WICKER>he was placed in an isolation

497
00:20:11 --> 00:20:13
<v MR. WICKER>cell, handcuffed, beaten until

498
00:20:13 --> 00:20:16
<v MR. WICKER>he died.

499
00:20:16 --> 00:20:18
<v MR. WICKER>In the months following his

500
00:20:18 --> 00:20:19
<v MR. WICKER>death, russian officials

501
00:20:19 --> 00:20:21
<v MR. WICKER>repeatedly denied facts

502
00:20:21 --> 00:20:24
<v MR. WICKER>concerning his health condition.

503
00:20:24 --> 00:20:26
<v MR. WICKER>The russians state -- russian

504
00:20:26 --> 00:20:28
<v MR. WICKER>state investigative committee

505
00:20:28 --> 00:20:29
<v MR. WICKER>claimed that magnitsky was not

506
00:20:29 --> 00:20:32
<v MR. WICKER>pressured, nor tortured, but

507
00:20:32 --> 00:20:34
<v MR. WICKER>died naturally of heart

508
00:20:34 --> 00:20:35
<v MR. WICKER>disease, and his death was

509
00:20:35 --> 00:20:37
<v MR. WICKER>nobody's fault.

510
00:20:37 --> 00:20:37
<v MR. WICKER>this is from the russian

511
00:20:37 --> 00:20:41
<v MR. WICKER>government.

512
00:20:41 --> 00:20:43
<v MR. WICKER>Since then, Mr. Magnitsky --

513
00:20:43 --> 00:20:45
<v MR. WICKER>since Mr. Magnitsky's death,

514
00:20:45 --> 00:20:48
<v MR. WICKER>two subsequent reviews have

515
00:20:48 --> 00:20:49
<v MR. WICKER>helped clarify some of the

516
00:20:49 --> 00:20:51
<v MR. WICKER>facts.

517
00:20:51 --> 00:20:54
<v MR. WICKER>In late December of 2009, the

518
00:20:54 --> 00:20:56
<v MR. WICKER>moscow public oversight

519
00:20:56 --> 00:20:57
<v MR. WICKER>commission, an independent

520
00:20:57 --> 00:21:01
<v MR. WICKER>watchdog mandated under russian

521
00:21:01 --> 00:21:03
<v MR. WICKER>law to monitor human rights,

522
00:21:03 --> 00:21:04
<v MR. WICKER>issued its conclusions on this

523
00:21:04 --> 00:21:07
<v MR. WICKER>case.

524
00:21:07 --> 00:21:09
<v MR. WICKER>And this independent russian

525
00:21:09 --> 00:21:12
<v MR. WICKER>oversight commission stated that

526
00:21:12 --> 00:21:15
<v MR. WICKER>in detention magnitsky had been

527
00:21:15 --> 00:21:17
<v MR. WICKER>subjected to torture, physical

528
00:21:17 --> 00:21:18
<v MR. WICKER>and psychological pressure,

529
00:21:18 --> 00:21:20
<v MR. WICKER>that he was denied medical

530
00:21:20 --> 00:21:23
<v MR. WICKER>care, and that his right to

531
00:21:23 --> 00:21:26
<v MR. WICKER>life had been violated by the

532
00:21:26 --> 00:21:28
<v MR. WICKER>russian state.

533
00:21:28 --> 00:21:30
<v MR. WICKER>The conclusions were sent to the

534
00:21:30 --> 00:21:32
<v MR. WICKER>russian general prosecutor's

535
00:21:32 --> 00:21:33
<v MR. WICKER>office, the russian state

536
00:21:33 --> 00:21:35
<v MR. WICKER>investigative committee, the

537
00:21:35 --> 00:21:37
<v MR. WICKER>russian ministry of justice,

538
00:21:37 --> 00:21:40
<v MR. WICKER>and the presidential commission.

539
00:21:40 --> 00:21:43
<v MR. WICKER>none of these agencies have

540
00:21:43 --> 00:21:43
<v MR. WICKER>responded to the report's

541
00:21:43 --> 00:21:46
<v MR. WICKER>conclusions.

542
00:21:46 --> 00:21:48
<v MR. WICKER>Now, more recently a second

543
00:21:48 --> 00:21:50
<v MR. WICKER>finding was issued by the

544
00:21:50 --> 00:21:50
<v MR. WICKER>russian President's human rights

545
00:21:50 --> 00:21:53
<v MR. WICKER>council.

546
00:21:53 --> 00:21:54
<v MR. WICKER>It issued it independent expert

547
00:21:54 --> 00:21:56
<v MR. WICKER>findings on the case.

548
00:21:56 --> 00:22:00
<v MR. WICKER>The report found that magnitsky

549
00:22:00 --> 00:22:02
<v MR. WICKER>was arrested on trumped-up

550
00:22:02 --> 00:22:04
<v MR. WICKER>charges, yet they're being

551
00:22:05 --> 00:22:06
<v MR. WICKER>brought forward again after his

552
00:22:06 --> 00:22:08
<v MR. WICKER>unfortunate death.

553
00:22:08 --> 00:22:11
<v MR. WICKER>In breach of russian law, and

554
00:22:11 --> 00:22:12
<v MR. WICKER>in breach of the european human

555
00:22:12 --> 00:22:14
<v MR. WICKER>rights convention and that his

556
00:22:14 --> 00:22:16
<v MR. WICKER>prosecution was unlawful, that

557
00:22:16 --> 00:22:17
<v MR. WICKER>he was systemically denied

558
00:22:17 --> 00:22:20
<v MR. WICKER>medical care and that he was

559
00:22:20 --> 00:22:21
<v MR. WICKER>beaten in custody, which was

560
00:22:21 --> 00:22:23
<v MR. WICKER>the proximate cause of his death

561
00:22:23 --> 00:22:25
<v MR. WICKER>and that his medical records

562
00:22:25 --> 00:22:28
<v MR. WICKER>were falsified and that there is

563
00:22:28 --> 00:22:30
<v MR. WICKER>an ongoing cover-up and

564
00:22:30 --> 00:22:37
<v MR. WICKER>resistance by all government

565
00:22:37 --> 00:22:40
<v MR. WICKER>bodies to investigate.

566
00:22:40 --> 00:22:42
<v MR. WICKER>mr. President, senator cardin

567
00:22:42 --> 00:22:45
<v MR. WICKER>and I and senator Mccain and

568
00:22:45 --> 00:22:48
<v MR. WICKER>others have no choice but to

569
00:22:48 --> 00:22:51
<v MR. WICKER>continue coming to this floor,

570
00:22:51 --> 00:22:53
<v MR. WICKER>continue using every forum that

571
00:22:53 --> 00:22:58
<v MR. WICKER>we can possibly use to bring

572
00:22:58 --> 00:22:59
<v MR. WICKER>these facts to light.

573
00:22:59 --> 00:23:01
<v MR. WICKER>and -- I would yield back,

574
00:23:01 --> 00:23:03
<v MR. WICKER>I've taken quite a bit of our

575
00:23:03 --> 00:23:07
<v MR. WICKER>time with my prepared statement.

576
00:23:07 --> 00:23:11
<v MR. WICKER>I yield back to my friend from

577
00:23:11 --> 00:23:14
<v MR. WICKER>maryland as to any other

578
00:23:14 --> 00:23:16
<v MR. WICKER>thoughts that he might have.

579
00:23:16 --> 00:23:17
<v MR. WICKER>I want to commend his leadership

580
00:23:17 --> 00:23:21
<v MR. WICKER>with regard to the legislation.

581
00:23:21 --> 00:23:25
<v MR. WICKER>do I understand now, senator,

582
00:23:25 --> 00:23:26
<v MR. WICKER>that we have some 30 cosponsors?

583
00:23:27 --> 00:23:28
<v MR. CARDIN>that is correct.

584
00:23:28 --> 00:23:29
<v MR. CARDIN>Again, I thank you for your

585
00:23:29 --> 00:23:29
<v MR. CARDIN>leadership and I thank you for

586
00:23:29 --> 00:23:32
<v MR. CARDIN>your comments.

587
00:23:32 --> 00:23:33
<v MR. CARDIN>We have 30 cosponsors of the

588
00:23:33 --> 00:23:35
<v MR. CARDIN>magnitsky legislation that I'm

589
00:23:35 --> 00:23:38
<v MR. CARDIN>going to be encouraging more of

590
00:23:38 --> 00:23:38
<v MR. CARDIN>our colleagues to join us in

591
00:23:38 --> 00:23:39
<v MR. CARDIN>cosponsorship.

592
00:23:40 --> 00:23:41
<v MR. CARDIN>i want to talk a little bit

593
00:23:41 --> 00:23:42
<v MR. CARDIN>about that, if I might.

594
00:23:42 --> 00:23:45
<v MR. CARDIN>Let me underscore the point that

595
00:23:45 --> 00:23:47
<v MR. CARDIN>senator wicker pointed out.

596
00:23:47 --> 00:23:48
<v MR. CARDIN>Mr. Magnitsky died two years

597
00:23:48 --> 00:23:49
<v MR. CARDIN>ago.

598
00:23:49 --> 00:23:51
<v MR. CARDIN>Through crimes that were

599
00:23:51 --> 00:23:53
<v MR. CARDIN>perpetrated on him that have

600
00:23:53 --> 00:23:56
<v MR. CARDIN>been well documented.

601
00:23:56 --> 00:23:58
<v MR. CARDIN>The russian federation is now

602
00:23:58 --> 00:24:01
<v MR. CARDIN>charging him after his death

603
00:24:01 --> 00:24:04
<v MR. CARDIN>with those crimes.

604
00:24:04 --> 00:24:07
<v MR. CARDIN>After his death.

605
00:24:07 --> 00:24:09
<v MR. CARDIN>Not even in stallen's time

606
00:24:09 --> 00:24:10
<v MR. CARDIN>did -- stalin's times did they

607
00:24:10 --> 00:24:12
<v MR. CARDIN>try people after they died.

608
00:24:12 --> 00:24:14
<v MR. CARDIN>This is the first time in

609
00:24:14 --> 00:24:15
<v MR. CARDIN>russian history a man has been

610
00:24:15 --> 00:24:17
<v MR. CARDIN>tried after his death.

611
00:24:17 --> 00:24:20
<v MR. CARDIN>Further, they have summoned

612
00:24:20 --> 00:24:22
<v MR. CARDIN>mr. Magnitsky's widow and ailing

613
00:24:22 --> 00:24:24
<v MR. CARDIN>mother as witnesses.

614
00:24:24 --> 00:24:25
<v MR. CARDIN>This is a new chapter in brazen

615
00:24:25 --> 00:24:27
<v MR. CARDIN>impunity.

616
00:24:27 --> 00:24:29
<v MR. CARDIN>An editorial last week in &quot;the

617
00:24:29 --> 00:24:31
<v MR. CARDIN>fangs times&quot; observed that if

618
00:24:31 --> 00:24:33
<v MR. CARDIN>he's convicted -- I'm going to

619
00:24:33 --> 00:24:35
<v MR. CARDIN>quote from the the financial

620
00:24:35 --> 00:24:37
<v MR. CARDIN>times -- &quot; the accused

621
00:24:37 --> 00:24:41
<v MR. CARDIN>citizenship could be revoked,

622
00:24:41 --> 00:24:42
<v MR. CARDIN>exiled, forced to die somewhere

623
00:24:42 --> 00:24:45
<v MR. CARDIN>else end -- quote -- .&quot;

624
00:24:45 --> 00:24:45
<v MR. CARDIN>that might be fun if it wasn't

625
00:24:45 --> 00:24:51
<v MR. CARDIN>real.

626
00:24:51 --> 00:24:52
<v MR. CARDIN>If it wasn't enough, an

627
00:24:53 --> 00:24:54
<v MR. CARDIN>extradition treaty.

628
00:24:54 --> 00:24:56
<v MR. CARDIN>Legal forces like what we --

629
00:24:56 --> 00:24:59
<v MR. CARDIN>farces like we've seen in the

630
00:24:59 --> 00:25:00
<v MR. CARDIN>case of sergei magnitsky or many

631
00:25:00 --> 00:25:02
<v MR. CARDIN>others bring reasonable people

632
00:25:02 --> 00:25:04
<v MR. CARDIN>to only two conclusions, both

633
00:25:04 --> 00:25:05
<v MR. CARDIN>of which are profoundly

634
00:25:05 --> 00:25:07
<v MR. CARDIN>disturbing.

635
00:25:07 --> 00:25:09
<v MR. CARDIN>Either senior leaders are not

636
00:25:09 --> 00:25:12
<v MR. CARDIN>the ones running the country,

637
00:25:12 --> 00:25:15
<v MR. CARDIN>or the senior leadership is

638
00:25:15 --> 00:25:17
<v MR. CARDIN>complicit in these outrages.

639
00:25:17 --> 00:25:18
<v MR. CARDIN>The magnitsky story sounds like

640
00:25:18 --> 00:25:23
<v MR. CARDIN>a hollywood thriller, but his

641
00:25:23 --> 00:25:25
<v MR. CARDIN>case is real, and the rampant

642
00:25:25 --> 00:25:26
<v MR. CARDIN>corruption, violence and

643
00:25:26 --> 00:25:27
<v MR. CARDIN>lawlessness does exist in the

644
00:25:27 --> 00:25:29
<v MR. CARDIN>russian government.

645
00:25:29 --> 00:25:32
<v MR. CARDIN>His cause has become a global

646
00:25:32 --> 00:25:34
<v MR. CARDIN>campaign for justice.

647
00:25:34 --> 00:25:36
<v MR. CARDIN>As senator wicker pointed out,

648
00:25:36 --> 00:25:39
<v MR. CARDIN>the popular opinion in russia is

649
00:25:39 --> 00:25:41
<v MR. CARDIN>on the side of justice.

650
00:25:41 --> 00:25:45
<v MR. CARDIN>You there's been over thousand

651
00:25:45 --> 00:25:46
<v MR. CARDIN>stories on -- 4,000 stories on

652
00:25:46 --> 00:25:46
<v MR. CARDIN>sergei magnitsky since his death

653
00:25:46 --> 00:25:48
<v MR. CARDIN>in russia.

654
00:25:48 --> 00:25:50
<v MR. CARDIN>We know from countless

655
00:25:50 --> 00:25:54
<v MR. CARDIN>historical cases such as the

656
00:25:54 --> 00:25:58
<v MR. CARDIN>death as the anti-apart ties

657
00:25:58 --> 00:26:00
<v MR. CARDIN>activist steve bitko in 1977,

658
00:26:00 --> 00:26:03
<v MR. CARDIN>that sometimes one person's

659
00:26:03 --> 00:26:05
<v MR. CARDIN>death can change the system.

660
00:26:05 --> 00:26:06
<v MR. CARDIN>Since we're now on the

661
00:26:06 --> 00:26:09
<v MR. CARDIN>internet, such change often

662
00:26:09 --> 00:26:09
<v MR. CARDIN>comes faster than expected.

663
00:26:09 --> 00:26:10
<v MR. CARDIN>Mr. President, imi'm going to

664
00:26:10 --> 00:26:12
<v MR. CARDIN>comment about the legislation

665
00:26:12 --> 00:26:15
<v MR. CARDIN>that I filed and the need for us

666
00:26:15 --> 00:26:16
<v MR. CARDIN>to consider that, but I notice

667
00:26:16 --> 00:26:17
<v MR. CARDIN>that senator shaheen is on the

668
00:26:17 --> 00:26:18
<v MR. CARDIN>floor.

669
00:26:18 --> 00:26:20
<v MR. CARDIN>Senator shaheen is a member of

670
00:26:20 --> 00:26:23
<v MR. CARDIN>the helsinki commission.

671
00:26:23 --> 00:26:24
<v MR. CARDIN>she also chairs the european

672
00:26:24 --> 00:26:25
<v MR. CARDIN>subcommittee on the senate

673
00:26:25 --> 00:26:27
<v MR. CARDIN>foreign relations committee and

674
00:26:27 --> 00:26:29
<v MR. CARDIN>has been an outspoken champion

675
00:26:29 --> 00:26:31
<v MR. CARDIN>on behalf of human rights.

676
00:26:31 --> 00:26:33
<v MR. CARDIN>And I'm pleased that she's here

677
00:26:33 --> 00:26:35
<v MR. CARDIN>and I'd like to give her an

678
00:26:35 --> 00:26:36
<v MR. CARDIN>opportunity, I see that she is

679
00:26:36 --> 00:26:38
<v MR. CARDIN>prepared to talk about this

680
00:26:38 --> 00:26:39
<v MR. CARDIN>issue.

681
00:26:39 --> 00:26:40
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>Mr. President.

682
00:26:40 --> 00:26:43
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

683
00:26:43 --> 00:26:44
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senator from new hampshire.

684
00:26:44 --> 00:26:45
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>thank you,

685
00:26:45 --> 00:26:47
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>senator cardin.

686
00:26:47 --> 00:26:48
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>I want to thank you and senator

687
00:26:48 --> 00:26:50
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>wicker for your efforts today,

688
00:26:50 --> 00:26:51
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>coming down to the floor to

689
00:26:51 --> 00:26:52
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>raise this important human

690
00:26:52 --> 00:26:55
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>rights issue.

691
00:26:55 --> 00:26:56
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>As you say, if we didn't see

692
00:26:56 --> 00:26:58
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>the facts, we would believe

693
00:26:58 --> 00:27:01
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>this was fiction, what's going

694
00:27:01 --> 00:27:03
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>on in russia today.

695
00:27:03 --> 00:27:05
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>But I think these efforts are

696
00:27:05 --> 00:27:07
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>particularly important, given

697
00:27:07 --> 00:27:08
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>what's happening today in

698
00:27:08 --> 00:27:10
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>russia.

699
00:27:10 --> 00:27:10
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>We've seen historic

700
00:27:10 --> 00:27:12
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>demonstrations on the streets of

701
00:27:13 --> 00:27:14
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>moscow over the last several

702
00:27:14 --> 00:27:15
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>months.

703
00:27:15 --> 00:27:18
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>Ordinary russian citizens, fed

704
00:27:18 --> 00:27:21
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>up with nearly a decade of

705
00:27:21 --> 00:27:22
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>corruption, have courageously

706
00:27:22 --> 00:27:24
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>taken to the streets to demand

707
00:27:24 --> 00:27:27
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>that their voices be heard.

708
00:27:27 --> 00:27:29
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>the fraudulent duma elections

709
00:27:29 --> 00:27:30
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>and the cynical and manipulative

710
00:27:30 --> 00:27:33
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>decision by prime minister putin

711
00:27:33 --> 00:27:34
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>to return to the presidency have

712
00:27:34 --> 00:27:36
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>reawakened civil society

713
00:27:36 --> 00:27:40
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>throughout russia.

714
00:27:40 --> 00:27:44
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>As a leading russian social

715
00:27:44 --> 00:27:47
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>activist, alexi novalni wrote

716
00:27:47 --> 00:27:48
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>following the peaceful December

717
00:27:48 --> 00:27:49
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>demonstrations, -- quote -- &quot;we

718
00:27:49 --> 00:27:51
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>all have the only weapon we need

719
00:27:51 --> 00:27:54
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>and the most powerful.

720
00:27:54 --> 00:27:54
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>That is the sense of

721
00:27:54 --> 00:27:56
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>self-respect.&quot;

722
00:27:56 --> 00:27:58
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>today as we call for justice for

723
00:27:58 --> 00:28:01
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>human rights abuses in russia,

724
00:28:01 --> 00:28:02
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>we also stand with those brave

725
00:28:02 --> 00:28:05
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>russian citizens who have risked

726
00:28:05 --> 00:28:07
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>so much in calling for their

727
00:28:07 --> 00:28:08
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>rights to be respected, just as

728
00:28:08 --> 00:28:10
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>sergei magnitsky did.

729
00:28:10 --> 00:28:12
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>As we've seen throughout this

730
00:28:12 --> 00:28:15
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>last year of upheaval around the

731
00:28:15 --> 00:28:16
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>globe, the rising voice of a

732
00:28:16 --> 00:28:19
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>public driven to peaceful

733
00:28:19 --> 00:28:21
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>protest can be deafening.

734
00:28:21 --> 00:28:22
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>Prime minister putin and his

735
00:28:22 --> 00:28:26
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>regime would be wise to listen

736
00:28:26 --> 00:28:29
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>to the people of russia.

737
00:28:29 --> 00:28:32
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>I also want to echo what

738
00:28:32 --> 00:28:35
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>senators wicker and cardin have

739
00:28:35 --> 00:28:37
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>said about their -- the

740
00:28:37 --> 00:28:38
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>importance of passing the sergei

741
00:28:38 --> 00:28:39
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>magnitsky rule of law

742
00:28:39 --> 00:28:42
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>accountability act.

743
00:28:42 --> 00:28:44
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>There are now 28 senate

744
00:28:44 --> 00:28:46
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>cosponsors, I am one of those

745
00:28:46 --> 00:28:48
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>cosponsors and I'm proud to be,

746
00:28:48 --> 00:28:49
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>and I want to associate myself

747
00:28:49 --> 00:28:51
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>with what you all have said on

748
00:28:51 --> 00:28:54
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>the floor of the senate today.

749
00:28:54 --> 00:28:55
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>The case of Mr. Magnitsky is a

750
00:28:55 --> 00:28:57
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>tragic one.

751
00:28:57 --> 00:28:58
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>He was falsely imprisoned,

752
00:28:58 --> 00:29:01
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>beaten, denied medical care,

753
00:29:01 --> 00:29:03
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>and ultimately killed, as you

754
00:29:03 --> 00:29:04
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>all have so eloquently

755
00:29:04 --> 00:29:07
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>explained.

756
00:29:07 --> 00:29:08
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>And to this day, no one has

757
00:29:08 --> 00:29:10
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>been held accountable for his

758
00:29:10 --> 00:29:13
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>tragic and unnecessary killing.

759
00:29:13 --> 00:29:15
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>We stand here today to press for

760
00:29:15 --> 00:29:17
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>accountability in

761
00:29:17 --> 00:29:18
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>Mr. Magnitsky's death.

762
00:29:18 --> 00:29:20
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>However, I think it's important

763
00:29:20 --> 00:29:22
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>for us to reiterate that this is

764
00:29:22 --> 00:29:25
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>more than simply a question of

765
00:29:25 --> 00:29:26
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>one man's tragic case.

766
00:29:27 --> 00:29:29
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>The state department's human

767
00:29:29 --> 00:29:32
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>rights report for this year

768
00:29:32 --> 00:29:34
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>describes numerous violations.

769
00:29:34 --> 00:29:36
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>As you said so well, senator

770
00:29:36 --> 00:29:39
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>cardin, attacks on

771
00:29:39 --> 00:29:40
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>journalists, physical abuse of

772
00:29:40 --> 00:29:42
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>citizens, harsh prison

773
00:29:42 --> 00:29:43
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>conditions, politically

774
00:29:43 --> 00:29:44
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>motivated imprisonments and

775
00:29:44 --> 00:29:46
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>other government hairmts and

776
00:29:46 --> 00:29:47
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>violence.

777
00:29:47 --> 00:29:51
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>The european court of human

778
00:29:51 --> 00:29:52
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>rights has issued more than 210

779
00:29:52 --> 00:29:53
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>judgments holding russia

780
00:29:53 --> 00:29:55
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>responsible for grave human

00:29:55 --> 00:29:57
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>rights violations including be

782
00:29:57 --> 00:29:59
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>abductions, killings, and

<v MRS. SHAHEEN>throughout the northern

00:30:00 --> 00:30:03
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>caucuses.

786
00:30:03 --> 00:30:04
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>There are more cases like

787
00:30:04 --> 00:30:06
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>magnitsky which is why the bill

788
00:30:06 --> 00:30:08
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>before us is so important.

789
00:30:08 --> 00:30:10
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>it seeks to ensure that no human

790
00:30:10 --> 00:30:10
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>rights abusers in russia or

791
00:30:10 --> 00:30:12
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>elsewhere in the world are

<v MRS. SHAHEEN>utilizing our american financial

795
00:30:17 --> 00:30:19
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>system.

796
00:30:19 --> 00:30:21
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>As chair of the subcommittee on

797
00:30:21 --> 00:30:24
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>european affairs I was pleased

798
00:30:24 --> 00:30:25
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>to preside over a hearing on

799
00:30:25 --> 00:30:27
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>your -- our magnitsky bill and

800
00:30:27 --> 00:30:27
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>on the state of human rights in

801
00:30:27 --> 00:30:29
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>russia.

802
00:30:29 --> 00:30:31
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>i want to thank Chairman Kerry

803
00:30:31 --> 00:30:32
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>for helping to make that hearing

804
00:30:32 --> 00:30:33
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>possible.

805
00:30:33 --> 00:30:35
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>During the hearing we had had a

806
00:30:35 --> 00:30:36
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>very constructive conversation

807
00:30:36 --> 00:30:39
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>with state department officials

808
00:30:39 --> 00:30:41
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>and we heard unanimous support

809
00:30:41 --> 00:30:43
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>for the legislation from an

810
00:30:43 --> 00:30:45
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>impressive panel of human rights

811
00:30:45 --> 00:30:46
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>activists and russian experts.

812
00:30:46 --> 00:30:48
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>We've also received letters,

813
00:30:48 --> 00:30:50
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>and I'm going to introduce these

814
00:30:50 --> 00:30:51
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>letters into the record, from

815
00:30:51 --> 00:30:53
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>leading human rights and civil

816
00:30:53 --> 00:30:54
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>society leaders in russia

817
00:30:54 --> 00:30:56
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>calling on the senate to pass

818
00:30:56 --> 00:30:58
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>the magnitsky bill.

819
00:30:58 --> 00:30:59
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>Around the world, governments

820
00:30:59 --> 00:31:00
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>are also taking up this

821
00:31:00 --> 00:31:02
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>important call.

822
00:31:02 --> 00:31:04
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>The european parliament,

823
00:31:04 --> 00:31:05
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>canada, the netherlands are

824
00:31:05 --> 00:31:07
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>considering similar pieces of

825
00:31:07 --> 00:31:09
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>legislation and this summer the

826
00:31:09 --> 00:31:10
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>u.S. State department barred

827
00:31:10 --> 00:31:13
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>dozens of russian officials from

828
00:31:13 --> 00:31:14
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>traveling to the U.S. Over their

829
00:31:14 --> 00:31:14
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>involvement in the death of

830
00:31:15 --> 00:31:17
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>magnitsky.

831
00:31:17 --> 00:31:18
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>I

832
00:31:19 --> 00:31:19
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>-- I want to commend the

833
00:31:19 --> 00:31:21
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>administration and particularly

834
00:31:21 --> 00:31:22
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>secretary clinton for her strong

835
00:31:22 --> 00:31:24
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>words condemning the recent

836
00:31:24 --> 00:31:25
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>fraudulent elections in russia.

837
00:31:25 --> 00:31:29
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>But despite all these efforts,

838
00:31:29 --> 00:31:33
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>there is more we can do to

839
00:31:33 --> 00:31:35
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>support human rights in civil

840
00:31:35 --> 00:31:37
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>society, freedom of expression

841
00:31:37 --> 00:31:39
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>in russia.

842
00:31:39 --> 00:31:40
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>Passing the magnitsky bill this

843
00:31:40 --> 00:31:41
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>year is one of them.

844
00:31:41 --> 00:31:43
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>In the midst of an election

845
00:31:43 --> 00:31:44
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>year, at a time of difficult

846
00:31:44 --> 00:31:46
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>partisanship, I believe this is

847
00:31:46 --> 00:31:48
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>one effort, as we have seen so

848
00:31:48 --> 00:31:50
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>well from senator cardin and

849
00:31:50 --> 00:31:51
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>senator wicker here today, this

850
00:31:51 --> 00:31:53
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>is one effort that both sides of

851
00:31:53 --> 00:31:55
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>the aisle can agree on, and we

852
00:31:55 --> 00:31:58
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>canned here unambiguously today

853
00:31:58 --> 00:32:00
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>in support of rule of law,

854
00:32:00 --> 00:32:01
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>democracy and respect for human

855
00:32:01 --> 00:32:03
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>rights in russia, and I hope

856
00:32:03 --> 00:32:04
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>that our colleagues in the

857
00:32:04 --> 00:32:06
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>congress and at the state

858
00:32:06 --> 00:32:06
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>department will work

859
00:32:06 --> 00:32:09
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>constructively in the months

860
00:32:09 --> 00:32:10
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>ahead to pass this critical

861
00:32:10 --> 00:32:12
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>piece of legislation.

862
00:32:12 --> 00:32:14
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>And, Mr. President, senators,

863
00:32:14 --> 00:32:16
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>before I yield the floor, I also

864
00:32:16 --> 00:32:19
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>think it's important to call

865
00:32:19 --> 00:32:20
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>attention to the particularly

866
00:32:21 --> 00:32:22
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>egregious act that russia

867
00:32:23 --> 00:32:24
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>committed in recent days before

868
00:32:25 --> 00:32:26
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>the united nations when they

869
00:32:26 --> 00:32:27
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>voted the security council

870
00:32:27 --> 00:32:29
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>resolution aimed at halting the

871
00:32:29 --> 00:32:31
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>ongoing violence in syria.

872
00:32:31 --> 00:32:33
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>today more than 25,000 people

873
00:32:33 --> 00:32:34
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>have fled syria.

874
00:32:34 --> 00:32:36
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>More than 7,000 innocent syrians

875
00:32:36 --> 00:32:43
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>have died at the hands of

876
00:32:43 --> 00:32:44
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>President Assad, and despite

877
00:32:44 --> 00:32:45
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>syria's growing isolation,

878
00:32:45 --> 00:32:46
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>russia continues to harbor and

879
00:32:46 --> 00:32:49
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>arm the syrian regime.

880
00:32:49 --> 00:32:50
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>This is unacceptable, and i

881
00:32:50 --> 00:32:53
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>think our passage of the

882
00:32:53 --> 00:32:56
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>magnitsky bill will send a very

883
00:32:56 --> 00:32:58
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>strong sign to russia that not

884
00:32:58 --> 00:33:01
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>only in the magnitsky case and

885
00:33:01 --> 00:33:02
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>other human rights abuses in

886
00:33:02 --> 00:33:04
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>country are they going to be

887
00:33:04 --> 00:33:05
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>held accountable, but their

888
00:33:05 --> 00:33:07
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>actions internationally will

889
00:33:07 --> 00:33:08
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>also make them accountable to

890
00:33:08 --> 00:33:10
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>the international community.

891
00:33:10 --> 00:33:12
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>so, again, thank you to senator

892
00:33:12 --> 00:33:13
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>cardin and senator wicker for

893
00:33:13 --> 00:33:15
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>your leadership on this issue.

894
00:33:15 --> 00:33:18
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>I am very pleased and honored to

895
00:33:18 --> 00:33:20
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>be able to join you in making

896
00:33:20 --> 00:33:21
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>this fight.

897
00:33:21 --> 00:33:23
<v MR. WICKER>well, Mr. President,

898
00:33:23 --> 00:33:25
<v MR. WICKER>we are honored to have senator

899
00:33:25 --> 00:33:26
<v MR. WICKER>shaheen join us, and I know

900
00:33:26 --> 00:33:27
<v MR. WICKER>there are others who would like

901
00:33:27 --> 00:33:32
<v MR. WICKER>to be here today.

902
00:33:32 --> 00:33:34
<v MR. WICKER>we are here to tell the sordid

903
00:33:34 --> 00:33:38
<v MR. WICKER>facts of this case, but we're

904
00:33:38 --> 00:33:38
<v MR. WICKER>also here because change can

905
00:33:38 --> 00:33:41
<v MR. WICKER>occur.

906
00:33:41 --> 00:33:42
<v MR. WICKER>If this were completely

907
00:33:42 --> 00:33:46
<v MR. WICKER>hopeless, what would be the

908
00:33:46 --> 00:33:48
<v MR. WICKER>point of this exercise?

909
00:33:48 --> 00:33:50
<v MR. WICKER>Change occurred in eastern

910
00:33:50 --> 00:33:52
<v MR. WICKER>europe, and I must admit there

911
00:33:52 --> 00:33:56
<v MR. WICKER>was a time in my younger days

912
00:33:56 --> 00:33:56
<v MR. WICKER>when I doubted it would ever

913
00:33:56 --> 00:34:00
<v MR. WICKER>occur.

914
00:34:00 --> 00:34:03
<v MR. WICKER>My pat is off to the intrepid

915
00:34:03 --> 00:34:06
<v MR. WICKER>members of the public oversight

916
00:34:06 --> 00:34:09
<v MR. WICKER>commission who had the courage

917
00:34:09 --> 00:34:14
<v MR. WICKER>to issue a report critical of

918
00:34:14 --> 00:34:15
<v MR. WICKER>their government, to the russian

919
00:34:15 --> 00:34:16
<v MR. WICKER>President's human rights

920
00:34:16 --> 00:34:17
<v MR. WICKER>council.

921
00:34:17 --> 00:34:19
<v MR. WICKER>So voices are being heard.

922
00:34:19 --> 00:34:28
<v MR. WICKER>There is a thread of truth

923
00:34:28 --> 00:34:30
<v MR. WICKER>coming from the almost iron

924
00:34:30 --> 00:34:32
<v MR. WICKER>curtain of authoritarianism that

925
00:34:32 --> 00:34:35
<v MR. WICKER>we have reverted to in russia.

926
00:34:35 --> 00:34:38
<v MR. WICKER>The senator from new hampshire

927
00:34:38 --> 00:34:41
<v MR. WICKER>mentioned other organizations in

928
00:34:41 --> 00:34:43
<v MR. WICKER>russia, and I'm glad she has

929
00:34:43 --> 00:34:46
<v MR. WICKER>inserted those letters into the

930
00:34:46 --> 00:34:48
<v MR. WICKER>record.

931
00:34:48 --> 00:34:50
<v MR. WICKER>I also would point out that I

932
00:34:50 --> 00:34:51
<v MR. WICKER>have to applaud the

933
00:34:51 --> 00:34:53
<v MR. WICKER>international reaction.

934
00:34:53 --> 00:34:57
<v MR. WICKER>in December, the european

935
00:34:57 --> 00:35:02
<v MR. WICKER>parliament passed a resolution

936
00:35:02 --> 00:35:05
<v MR. WICKER>recommending an E.U.-wide travel

937
00:35:05 --> 00:35:07
<v MR. WICKER>ban and asked that freeze for

938
00:35:07 --> 00:35:08
<v MR. WICKER>officials tied to magnitsky's

939
00:35:08 --> 00:35:13
<v MR. WICKER>death.

940
00:35:13 --> 00:35:15
<v MR. WICKER>but we need to act as a senate

941
00:35:15 --> 00:35:17
<v MR. WICKER>and as a congress, and so I'm

942
00:35:17 --> 00:35:21
<v MR. WICKER>calling on every senator within

943
00:35:21 --> 00:35:22
<v MR. WICKER>the sound of my voice today,

944
00:35:22 --> 00:35:24
<v MR. WICKER>Mr. President.

945
00:35:24 --> 00:35:28
<v MR. WICKER>Every legislative director

946
00:35:28 --> 00:35:30
<v MR. WICKER>dealing with defense and foreign

947
00:35:30 --> 00:35:33
<v MR. WICKER>policy issues once again to look

948
00:35:33 --> 00:35:35
<v MR. WICKER>at the sergei magnitsky rule of

949
00:35:35 --> 00:35:37
<v MR. WICKER>law accountability act.

950
00:35:37 --> 00:35:39
<v MR. WICKER>I will tell my friend from new

951
00:35:39 --> 00:35:43
<v MR. WICKER>hampshire the number is now up

952
00:35:43 --> 00:35:45
<v MR. WICKER>to 30 we learned on the floor

953
00:35:45 --> 00:35:46
<v MR. WICKER>today from senator cardin, so we

954
00:35:46 --> 00:35:48
<v MR. WICKER>have 30 senators involved.

955
00:35:48 --> 00:35:49
<v MR. WICKER>We really ought to have a

956
00:35:49 --> 00:35:52
<v MR. WICKER>majority of senators before the

957
00:35:52 --> 00:35:54
<v MR. WICKER>end of this day if people would

958
00:35:54 --> 00:35:56
<v MR. WICKER>just take the time to look.

959
00:35:56 --> 00:35:57
<v MR. WICKER>Again, I join here in

960
00:35:58 --> 00:35:59
<v MR. WICKER>congratulating the foreign

961
00:35:59 --> 00:36:04
<v MR. WICKER>relations committee on bringing

962
00:36:04 --> 00:36:06
<v MR. WICKER>further light to this.

963
00:36:06 --> 00:36:09
<v MR. WICKER>I thank the state department, as

964
00:36:09 --> 00:36:12
<v MR. WICKER>she said, and I would simply

965
00:36:12 --> 00:36:14
<v MR. WICKER>conclude my portion of this by

966
00:36:14 --> 00:36:19
<v MR. WICKER>saying recent events make it

967
00:36:19 --> 00:36:21
<v MR. WICKER>even more important that the

968
00:36:21 --> 00:36:23
<v MR. WICKER>foreign relations committee and

969
00:36:23 --> 00:36:24
<v MR. WICKER>this senate take up and pass

970
00:36:24 --> 00:36:27
<v MR. WICKER>this legislation.

971
00:36:27 --> 00:36:29
<v MR. WICKER>I urge all of my colleagues to

972
00:36:29 --> 00:36:30
<v MR. WICKER>consider joining us on this

973
00:36:30 --> 00:36:31
<v MR. WICKER>legislation.

974
00:36:32 --> 00:36:33
<v MR. CARDIN>let me, if I might.

975
00:36:34 --> 00:36:35
<v MR. CARDIN>senator shaheen, I want to thank

976
00:36:35 --> 00:36:36
<v MR. CARDIN>you for your comments, but more

977
00:36:36 --> 00:36:37
<v MR. CARDIN>importantly, I want to thank you

978
00:36:37 --> 00:36:39
<v MR. CARDIN>for your leadership.

979
00:36:39 --> 00:36:40
<v MR. CARDIN>The hearing that you held on the

980
00:36:40 --> 00:36:41
<v MR. CARDIN>sergei magnitsky bill was very,

981
00:36:41 --> 00:36:43
<v MR. CARDIN>very helpful.

982
00:36:43 --> 00:36:45
<v MR. CARDIN>First of all, I think in answer

983
00:36:45 --> 00:36:46
<v MR. CARDIN>to question of why we should

984
00:36:46 --> 00:36:47
<v MR. CARDIN>care.

985
00:36:47 --> 00:36:50
<v MR. CARDIN>Now, we all understand america's

986
00:36:50 --> 00:36:52
<v MR. CARDIN>leadership on moral issues, and

987
00:36:52 --> 00:36:54
<v MR. CARDIN>the world looks to america to

988
00:36:54 --> 00:36:56
<v MR. CARDIN>stand up against these

989
00:36:56 --> 00:36:58
<v MR. CARDIN>fundamental abuses of human

990
00:36:58 --> 00:37:00
<v MR. CARDIN>rights, so that in and of itself

991
00:37:00 --> 00:37:03
<v MR. CARDIN>is a reason for us to act, but

992
00:37:03 --> 00:37:07
<v MR. CARDIN>it was also apparent from the

993
00:37:07 --> 00:37:09
<v MR. CARDIN>hearings that these criminals,

994
00:37:09 --> 00:37:10
<v MR. CARDIN>these violations in russia

995
00:37:10 --> 00:37:11
<v MR. CARDIN>involve our financial

996
00:37:11 --> 00:37:12
<v MR. CARDIN>institutions.

997
00:37:12 --> 00:37:14
<v MR. CARDIN>So we are talking about the

998
00:37:14 --> 00:37:17
<v MR. CARDIN>integrity of american companies

999
00:37:17 --> 00:37:18
<v MR. CARDIN>to be able to deal -- do

1000
00:37:18 --> 00:37:21
<v MR. CARDIN>business internationally.

1001
00:37:21 --> 00:37:24
<v MR. CARDIN>So it's not only the moral issue

1002
00:37:24 --> 00:37:24
<v MR. CARDIN>that we have a right to speak

1003
00:37:24 --> 00:37:26
<v MR. CARDIN>out.

1004
00:37:26 --> 00:37:28
<v MR. CARDIN>As my two colleagues on the

1005
00:37:28 --> 00:37:29
<v MR. CARDIN>floor know, under the

1006
00:37:29 --> 00:37:32
<v MR. CARDIN>commitments that we all signed

1007
00:37:32 --> 00:37:36
<v MR. CARDIN>onto in the helsinki in 1975, we

1008
00:37:36 --> 00:37:38
<v MR. CARDIN>have committed ourselves to

1009
00:37:38 --> 00:37:40
<v MR. CARDIN>basic human rights and the

1010
00:37:40 --> 00:37:42
<v MR. CARDIN>obligation of any member state

1011
00:37:42 --> 00:37:45
<v MR. CARDIN>to question the conduct in

1012
00:37:45 --> 00:37:48
<v MR. CARDIN>another state.

1013
00:37:48 --> 00:37:49
<v MR. CARDIN>And russia is a signator of the

1014
00:37:49 --> 00:37:51
<v MR. CARDIN>helsinki final act, the united

1015
00:37:51 --> 00:37:56
<v MR. CARDIN>states is a signator, so we have

1016
00:37:56 --> 00:37:57
<v MR. CARDIN>a responsibility to -- to bring

1017
00:37:57 --> 00:37:58
<v MR. CARDIN>this to the attention.

1018
00:37:58 --> 00:37:59
<v MR. CARDIN>We can do more.

1019
00:37:59 --> 00:38:01
<v MR. CARDIN>What can we do about this?

1020
00:38:01 --> 00:38:02
<v MR. CARDIN>There are many aspects of the

1021
00:38:02 --> 00:38:03
<v MR. CARDIN>magnitsky tragedy that are

1022
00:38:03 --> 00:38:05
<v MR. CARDIN>difficult for us to pursue here

1023
00:38:05 --> 00:38:07
<v MR. CARDIN>in the united states.

1024
00:38:07 --> 00:38:08
<v MR. CARDIN>It can't be our criminal justice

1025
00:38:08 --> 00:38:09
<v MR. CARDIN>system.

1026
00:38:09 --> 00:38:10
<v MR. CARDIN>It's got to be the russian

1027
00:38:10 --> 00:38:13
<v MR. CARDIN>system that has to be reformed

1028
00:38:13 --> 00:38:16
<v MR. CARDIN>to deal with this, but there are

1029
00:38:16 --> 00:38:18
<v MR. CARDIN>steps that we can take, and the

1030
00:38:18 --> 00:38:19
<v MR. CARDIN>legislation that we all have

1031
00:38:19 --> 00:38:23
<v MR. CARDIN>filed recognizes that the right

1032
00:38:23 --> 00:38:25
<v MR. CARDIN>to visit america is a privilege

1033
00:38:25 --> 00:38:26
<v MR. CARDIN>granted by the united states.

1034
00:38:26 --> 00:38:28
<v MR. CARDIN>The V.C.R. Is a privilege.

1035
00:38:28 --> 00:38:29
<v MR. CARDIN>There is no guaranteed right to

1036
00:38:29 --> 00:38:32
<v MR. CARDIN>come to america.

1037
00:38:32 --> 00:38:36
<v MR. CARDIN>And one thing we can do is say

1038
00:38:36 --> 00:38:37
<v MR. CARDIN>those who are -- who are

1039
00:38:37 --> 00:38:40
<v MR. CARDIN>committing these gross human

1040
00:38:40 --> 00:38:42
<v MR. CARDIN>rights violations should not be

1041
00:38:42 --> 00:38:43
<v MR. CARDIN>given the privilege of entering

1042
00:38:43 --> 00:38:45
<v MR. CARDIN>into the united states.

1043
00:38:45 --> 00:38:48
<v MR. CARDIN>I want to acknowledge and thank

1044
00:38:48 --> 00:38:50
<v MR. CARDIN>secretary of state clinton for

1045
00:38:50 --> 00:38:51
<v MR. CARDIN>taking action against human

1046
00:38:51 --> 00:38:53
<v MR. CARDIN>rights violators.

1047
00:38:53 --> 00:38:55
<v MR. CARDIN>That's the right policy to do.

1048
00:38:55 --> 00:38:57
<v MR. CARDIN>the legislation that we have

1049
00:38:57 --> 00:39:00
<v MR. CARDIN>authored institutionalizes a

1050
00:39:00 --> 00:39:02
<v MR. CARDIN>process where we deny the right

1051
00:39:02 --> 00:39:04
<v MR. CARDIN>for those individuals to visit

1052
00:39:04 --> 00:39:06
<v MR. CARDIN>and come into the united states.

1053
00:39:06 --> 00:39:06
<v MR. CARDIN>Obviously, that has a price to

1054
00:39:06 --> 00:39:08
<v MR. CARDIN>them.

1055
00:39:08 --> 00:39:10
<v MR. CARDIN>Of course, what we're trying to

1056
00:39:10 --> 00:39:12
<v MR. CARDIN>do is get the government, in

1057
00:39:12 --> 00:39:12
<v MR. CARDIN>this case russia, to do what's

1058
00:39:12 --> 00:39:13
<v MR. CARDIN>right.

1059
00:39:13 --> 00:39:16
<v MR. CARDIN>The second thing we could do is

1060
00:39:16 --> 00:39:18
<v MR. CARDIN>deal with their financial

1061
00:39:18 --> 00:39:19
<v MR. CARDIN>participation in U.S.

1062
00:39:19 --> 00:39:22
<v MR. CARDIN>Institutions.

1063
00:39:22 --> 00:39:23
<v MR. CARDIN>These people do get involved in

1064
00:39:23 --> 00:39:25
<v MR. CARDIN>international finance.

1065
00:39:25 --> 00:39:27
<v MR. CARDIN>They do have resources that

1066
00:39:27 --> 00:39:29
<v MR. CARDIN>travel through U.S. Financial

1067
00:39:29 --> 00:39:33
<v MR. CARDIN>institutions, and we do have

1068
00:39:33 --> 00:39:34
<v MR. CARDIN>laws that allow us to hold those

1069
00:39:34 --> 00:39:35
<v MR. CARDIN>funds.

1070
00:39:35 --> 00:39:36
<v MR. CARDIN>Through due process, we can do

1071
00:39:36 --> 00:39:37
<v MR. CARDIN>that.

1072
00:39:37 --> 00:39:38
<v MR. CARDIN>And that is the reason why the

1073
00:39:38 --> 00:39:40
<v MR. CARDIN>legislation that we had talked

1074
00:39:40 --> 00:39:44
<v MR. CARDIN>about today, the legislation

1075
00:39:44 --> 00:39:45
<v MR. CARDIN>that I introduced along with my

1076
00:39:45 --> 00:39:46
<v MR. CARDIN>colleagues would

1077
00:39:46 --> 00:39:47
<v MR. CARDIN>institutionalize those types of

1078
00:39:47 --> 00:39:48
<v MR. CARDIN>changes.

1079
00:39:48 --> 00:39:50
<v MR. CARDIN>For those who think it May not

1080
00:39:50 --> 00:39:54
<v MR. CARDIN>mean much, let me just remind

1081
00:39:54 --> 00:39:56
<v MR. CARDIN>you about what we did when the

1082
00:39:56 --> 00:40:00
<v MR. CARDIN>soviet union denied the rights

1083
00:40:00 --> 00:40:00
<v MR. CARDIN>of jews to be able to leave the

1084
00:40:00 --> 00:40:02
<v MR. CARDIN>country.

1085
00:40:02 --> 00:40:06
<v MR. CARDIN>Here in the united states

1086
00:40:06 --> 00:40:06
<v MR. CARDIN>congress, we took action by

1087
00:40:06 --> 00:40:08
<v MR. CARDIN>legislation.

1088
00:40:08 --> 00:40:09
<v MR. CARDIN>Many said would that make any

1089
00:40:09 --> 00:40:12
<v MR. CARDIN>difference?

1090
00:40:12 --> 00:40:14
<v MR. CARDIN>It made a huge difference and it

1091
00:40:14 --> 00:40:16
<v MR. CARDIN>brought about change in the

1092
00:40:16 --> 00:40:19
<v MR. CARDIN>soviet union.

1093
00:40:19 --> 00:40:19
<v MR. CARDIN>other countries followed our

1094
00:40:19 --> 00:40:20
<v MR. CARDIN>leadership.

1095
00:40:20 --> 00:40:22
<v MR. CARDIN>As both of my colleagues have

1096
00:40:22 --> 00:40:23
<v MR. CARDIN>pointed out, if we act, other

1097
00:40:23 --> 00:40:26
<v MR. CARDIN>countries will act.

1098
00:40:26 --> 00:40:29
<v MR. CARDIN>It will become the norm, and

1099
00:40:29 --> 00:40:31
<v MR. CARDIN>that will help us establish the

1100
00:40:31 --> 00:40:33
<v MR. CARDIN>expectation that countries do

1101
00:40:33 --> 00:40:35
<v MR. CARDIN>need to address tragedies such

1102
00:40:35 --> 00:40:36
<v MR. CARDIN>as sergei magnitsky, hold those

1103
00:40:36 --> 00:40:38
<v MR. CARDIN>responsible accountable, and

1104
00:40:38 --> 00:40:40
<v MR. CARDIN>more importantly take steps so

1105
00:40:40 --> 00:40:42
<v MR. CARDIN>it never happens again.

1106
00:40:42 --> 00:40:45
<v MR. CARDIN>That is what we are attempting

1107
00:40:45 --> 00:40:46
<v MR. CARDIN>to do by moving forward with

1108
00:40:46 --> 00:40:50
<v MR. CARDIN>this legislation.

1109
00:40:50 --> 00:40:52
<v MR. CARDIN>As senator wicker said, we do

1110
00:40:52 --> 00:40:53
<v MR. CARDIN>urge our colleagues to join us

1111
00:40:53 --> 00:40:55
<v MR. CARDIN>in this effort.

1112
00:40:55 --> 00:40:58
<v MR. CARDIN>Senator wicker, you mentioned

1113
00:40:58 --> 00:41:00
<v MR. CARDIN>what's happening around the

1114
00:41:00 --> 00:41:01
<v MR. CARDIN>world as we see countries go

1115
00:41:01 --> 00:41:02
<v MR. CARDIN>through a democratic

1116
00:41:02 --> 00:41:03
<v MR. CARDIN>transformation that we never

1117
00:41:03 --> 00:41:05
<v MR. CARDIN>thought we would see.

1118
00:41:05 --> 00:41:06
<v MR. CARDIN>We saw in our lifetime what

1119
00:41:06 --> 00:41:08
<v MR. CARDIN>happened in eastern europe.

1120
00:41:08 --> 00:41:09
<v MR. CARDIN>And now we see some really model

1121
00:41:09 --> 00:41:11
<v MR. CARDIN>democracies.

1122
00:41:11 --> 00:41:14
<v MR. CARDIN>Our nato allies, that countries

1123
00:41:14 --> 00:41:16
<v MR. CARDIN>just a few decades ago we

1124
00:41:16 --> 00:41:16
<v MR. CARDIN>thought would be our enemies to

1125
00:41:16 --> 00:41:19
<v MR. CARDIN>this day.

1126
00:41:19 --> 00:41:20
<v MR. CARDIN>so we have seen change occur.

1127
00:41:20 --> 00:41:22
<v MR. CARDIN>And we want to be on the right

1128
00:41:22 --> 00:41:25
<v MR. CARDIN>side of this issue, the right

1129
00:41:25 --> 00:41:26
<v MR. CARDIN>side of history, on moving

1130
00:41:26 --> 00:41:28
<v MR. CARDIN>forward russia with the type of

1131
00:41:28 --> 00:41:29
<v MR. CARDIN>reforms that the people of

1132
00:41:29 --> 00:41:30
<v MR. CARDIN>russia are entitled.

1133
00:41:30 --> 00:41:32
<v MR. CARDIN>We have the right to do that

1134
00:41:32 --> 00:41:34
<v MR. CARDIN>under the helsinki act.

1135
00:41:34 --> 00:41:36
<v MR. CARDIN>We have the responsibility to

1136
00:41:36 --> 00:41:38
<v MR. CARDIN>point these issues out, and we

1137
00:41:38 --> 00:41:39
<v MR. CARDIN>can take action that can make a

1138
00:41:39 --> 00:41:40
<v MR. CARDIN>huge difference.

1139
00:41:40 --> 00:41:42
<v MR. CARDIN>So, Mr. President, that is why

1140
00:41:42 --> 00:41:44
<v MR. CARDIN>we are engaged in this

1141
00:41:44 --> 00:41:46
<v MR. CARDIN>discussion today, to say look,

1142
00:41:46 --> 00:41:46
<v MR. CARDIN>we want russia to do the right

1143
00:41:46 --> 00:41:49
<v MR. CARDIN>thing.

1144
00:41:49 --> 00:41:50
<v MR. CARDIN>We want to speak out for the

1145
00:41:50 --> 00:41:53
<v MR. CARDIN>russian people, and we think

1146
00:41:53 --> 00:41:55
<v MR. CARDIN>that we can play a very

1147
00:41:55 --> 00:41:57
<v MR. CARDIN>important role.

1148
00:41:57 --> 00:41:58
<v MR. CARDIN>The U.S. Helsinki commission

1149
00:41:58 --> 00:41:59
<v MR. CARDIN>that I had the honor of being

1150
00:41:59 --> 00:42:01
<v MR. CARDIN>the senate chair and senator

1151
00:42:01 --> 00:42:03
<v MR. CARDIN>wicker is the lead republican on

1152
00:42:03 --> 00:42:04
<v MR. CARDIN>the senate side, we have a proud

1153
00:42:04 --> 00:42:05
<v MR. CARDIN>history of putting a spotlight

1154
00:42:05 --> 00:42:06
<v MR. CARDIN>on problems.

1155
00:42:06 --> 00:42:09
<v MR. CARDIN>People don't like name calling,

1156
00:42:09 --> 00:42:10
<v MR. CARDIN>but you have got to point out

1157
00:42:10 --> 00:42:12
<v MR. CARDIN>where the violations occur.

1158
00:42:12 --> 00:42:13
<v MR. CARDIN>Unfortunately, if you don't do

1159
00:42:13 --> 00:42:15
<v MR. CARDIN>it, it becomes statistics.

1160
00:42:15 --> 00:42:18
<v MR. CARDIN>When you put a face on it and

1161
00:42:18 --> 00:42:20
<v MR. CARDIN>you realize these are people who

1162
00:42:20 --> 00:42:20
<v MR. CARDIN>have families that had been

1163
00:42:20 --> 00:42:23
<v MR. CARDIN>abused because they are trying

1164
00:42:23 --> 00:42:25
<v MR. CARDIN>to do the right thing, you can

1165
00:42:25 --> 00:42:28
<v MR. CARDIN>get action, and that's why I am

1166
00:42:28 --> 00:42:30
<v MR. CARDIN>so proud of the legacy of the

1167
00:42:30 --> 00:42:33
<v MR. CARDIN>U.S. Helsinki commission on what

1168
00:42:33 --> 00:42:35
<v MR. CARDIN>we have been able to do.

1169
00:42:35 --> 00:42:36
<v MR. CARDIN>This is another chapter in that

1170
00:42:36 --> 00:42:38
<v MR. CARDIN>proud history of saying that

1171
00:42:38 --> 00:42:40
<v MR. CARDIN>we're going to stand up for

1172
00:42:40 --> 00:42:41
<v MR. CARDIN>basic human rights, that that's

1173
00:42:41 --> 00:42:44
<v MR. CARDIN>a priority of our country, and

1174
00:42:44 --> 00:42:45
<v MR. CARDIN>we can do better and we can do

1175
00:42:45 --> 00:42:47
<v MR. CARDIN>justice for sergei magnitsky and

1176
00:42:47 --> 00:42:50
<v MR. CARDIN>we could do justice for the

1177
00:42:50 --> 00:42:51
<v MR. CARDIN>people of russia.

1178
00:42:51 --> 00:42:53
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>will the senator

1179
00:42:53 --> 00:42:54
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>yield for a question?

1180
00:42:56 --> 00:42:57
<v MR. CARDIN>I would be glad to.

1181
00:42:56 --> 00:42:58
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>one of the things

1182
00:42:58 --> 00:43:00
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>you talked about so eloquently

1183
00:43:00 --> 00:43:04
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>is our ability here as we look

1184
00:43:04 --> 00:43:05
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>at our financial systems to help

1185
00:43:05 --> 00:43:06
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>impact what's happening in

1186
00:43:06 --> 00:43:07
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>russia.

1187
00:43:07 --> 00:43:09
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>One of the things that we heard

1188
00:43:09 --> 00:43:13
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>about at the hearing on the

1189
00:43:13 --> 00:43:16
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>magnitsky bill was from the head

1190
00:43:16 --> 00:43:18
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>of the american chamber in

1191
00:43:18 --> 00:43:20
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>russia who talked about what the

1192
00:43:20 --> 00:43:23
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>impact is on american companies

1193
00:43:23 --> 00:43:25
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>trying to do business of this

1194
00:43:25 --> 00:43:28
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>kind of case, and the concern

1195
00:43:28 --> 00:43:30
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>that it raises about issues of

1196
00:43:30 --> 00:43:34
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>corruption and the ability to

1197
00:43:34 --> 00:43:35
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>operate freely in russia.

1198
00:43:35 --> 00:43:37
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>So don't you agree that one of

1199
00:43:37 --> 00:43:39
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>the things that we can do is

1200
00:43:39 --> 00:43:43
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>also to urge those companies who

1201
00:43:43 --> 00:43:44
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>are operating in russia to speak

1202
00:43:44 --> 00:43:45
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>out when cases like this happen

1203
00:43:45 --> 00:43:47
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>and they have concerns about

1204
00:43:47 --> 00:43:49
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>what it does to their business

1205
00:43:49 --> 00:43:49
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>in the country.

1206
00:43:50 --> 00:43:51
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

1207
00:43:51 --> 00:43:52
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>majority's 30 minutes have

1208
00:43:52 --> 00:43:52
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>expired.

1209
00:43:52 --> 00:43:54
<v MR. CARDIN>thank you.

1210
00:43:54 --> 00:43:55
<v MR. CARDIN>We're going to yield the floor.

1211
00:43:55 --> 00:43:57
<v MR. CARDIN>Let me just agree with my

1212
00:43:57 --> 00:43:57
<v MR. CARDIN>colleague, senator shaheen.

1213
00:43:57 --> 00:43:59
<v MR. CARDIN>You're absolutely right.

1214
00:43:59 --> 00:44:00
<v MR. CARDIN>It's a lot easier for them to be

1215
00:44:00 --> 00:44:02
<v MR. CARDIN>able to speak out if they know

1216
00:44:02 --> 00:44:03
<v MR. CARDIN>that we are going to continue to

1217
00:44:03 --> 00:44:04
<v MR. CARDIN>raise these issues.

1218
00:44:04 --> 00:44:06
<v MR. CARDIN>Mr. President, I want to thank

1219
00:44:06 --> 00:44:06
<v MR. CARDIN>senator wicker and senator

1220
00:44:06 --> 00:44:07
<v MR. CARDIN>shaheen.

1221
00:44:07 --> 00:44:11
<v MR. CARDIN>I thank you for your attention.

1222
00:44:11 --> 00:44:14
<v MR. CARDIN>With that, we would yield the

1223
00:44:14 --> 00:44:15
<v MR. CARDIN>floor.

1224
00:44:15 --> 00:44:16
<v MR. BARRASSO>Mr. President.

1225
00:44:16 --> 00:44:17
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

1226
00:44:17 --> 00:44:17
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senator from wyoming is

1227
00:44:17 --> 00:44:18
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>recognized.

1228
00:44:18 --> 00:44:18
<v MR. BARRASSO>thank you,

1229
00:44:18 --> 00:44:20
<v MR. BARRASSO>Mr. President.

1230
00:44:20 --> 00:44:22
<v MR. BARRASSO>I come to the floor today as

1231
00:44:22 --> 00:44:23
<v MR. BARRASSO>someone who sat through the

1232
00:44:23 --> 00:44:24
<v MR. BARRASSO>President's state of the union,

1233
00:44:24 --> 00:44:26
<v MR. BARRASSO>and I have just come from a

1234
00:44:26 --> 00:44:27
<v MR. BARRASSO>senate energy committee hearing.

1235
00:44:27 --> 00:44:28
<v MR. BARRASSO>I sat through the state of the

1236
00:44:28 --> 00:44:29
<v MR. BARRASSO>union near the secretary of

1237
00:44:29 --> 00:44:32
<v MR. BARRASSO>energy and was happy when I

1238
00:44:32 --> 00:44:34
<v MR. BARRASSO>heard some of the comments of

1239
00:44:34 --> 00:44:37
<v MR. BARRASSO>the President As he talked of an

1240
00:44:37 --> 00:44:39
<v MR. BARRASSO>all of the above strategy,

1241
00:44:39 --> 00:44:40
<v MR. BARRASSO>needing all of the various

1242
00:44:40 --> 00:44:41
<v MR. BARRASSO>sources of energy.

1243
00:44:41 --> 00:44:44
<v MR. BARRASSO>but this monday, the President's

1244
00:44:44 --> 00:44:45
<v MR. BARRASSO>budget came out, which is very

1245
00:44:45 --> 00:44:48
<v MR. BARRASSO>different than that.

1246
00:44:48 --> 00:44:51
<v MR. BARRASSO>It's -- it's a budget that I'd

1247
00:44:51 --> 00:44:52
<v MR. BARRASSO>like to discuss this morning and

1248
00:44:52 --> 00:44:55
<v MR. BARRASSO>talk about because as I read

1249
00:44:55 --> 00:44:56
<v MR. BARRASSO>through it, it looks to me as

1250
00:44:56 --> 00:44:57
<v MR. BARRASSO>though the President Has

1251
00:44:57 --> 00:44:59
<v MR. BARRASSO>abandoned his role as leader of

1252
00:44:59 --> 00:45:01
<v MR. BARRASSO>the nation by not being honest

1253
00:45:01 --> 00:45:03
<v MR. BARRASSO>with the american people about

1254
00:45:03 --> 00:45:07
<v MR. BARRASSO>the -- the significance of the

1255
00:45:07 --> 00:45:10
<v MR. BARRASSO>debt that we as americans face.

1256
00:45:10 --> 00:45:11
<v MR. BARRASSO>To me, this budget ambushes the

1257
00:45:11 --> 00:45:14
<v MR. BARRASSO>american people.

1258
00:45:14 --> 00:45:17
<v MR. BARRASSO>The President Under the pretense

1259
00:45:17 --> 00:45:18
<v MR. BARRASSO>of economizing promises to cut

1260
00:45:18 --> 00:45:19
<v MR. BARRASSO>$4 trillion of deficit over ten

1261
00:45:19 --> 00:45:22
<v MR. BARRASSO>years.

1262
00:45:22 --> 00:45:24
<v MR. BARRASSO>but the budget itself actually

1263
00:45:24 --> 00:45:28
<v MR. BARRASSO>piles $11 trillion of new debt

1264
00:45:28 --> 00:45:31
<v MR. BARRASSO>in that same time frame.

1265
00:45:31 --> 00:45:35
<v MR. BARRASSO>Under the pretense of helping

1266
00:45:35 --> 00:45:36
<v MR. BARRASSO>everyone to prosper, to me the

1267
00:45:36 --> 00:45:38
<v MR. BARRASSO>President's budget buries every

1268
00:45:38 --> 00:45:40
<v MR. BARRASSO>single american under a mountain

1269
00:45:40 --> 00:45:41
<v MR. BARRASSO>of debt, and that is a debt

1270
00:45:41 --> 00:45:43
<v MR. BARRASSO>that's going to rob more and

1271
00:45:43 --> 00:45:45
<v MR. BARRASSO>more from their paychecks with

1272
00:45:45 --> 00:45:46
<v MR. BARRASSO>each passing year.

1273
00:45:46 --> 00:45:48
<v MR. BARRASSO>The savings that the President

1274
00:45:48 --> 00:45:50
<v MR. BARRASSO>Promises are not going to come,

1275
00:45:50 --> 00:45:51
<v MR. BARRASSO>and the spending that he demands

1276
00:45:51 --> 00:45:54
<v MR. BARRASSO>are things that we cannot

1277
00:45:54 --> 00:45:56
<v MR. BARRASSO>afford.

1278
00:45:56 --> 00:45:57
<v MR. BARRASSO>It just seems to me that this

1279
00:45:57 --> 00:45:59
<v MR. BARRASSO>President's budget is another

1280
00:45:59 --> 00:46:01
<v MR. BARRASSO>painful step on the road to

1281
00:46:01 --> 00:46:02
<v MR. BARRASSO>bankrupting america.

1282
00:46:02 --> 00:46:06
<v MR. BARRASSO>so here we are in the fourth

1283
00:46:06 --> 00:46:11
<v MR. BARRASSO>year of the presidency, and for

1284
00:46:11 --> 00:46:14
<v MR. BARRASSO>each of those four years the

1285
00:46:14 --> 00:46:16
<v MR. BARRASSO>deficit has exceeded

1286
00:46:16 --> 00:46:17
<v MR. BARRASSO>$1 trillion.

1287
00:46:17 --> 00:46:21
<v MR. BARRASSO>$1 trillion each of the four

1288
00:46:21 --> 00:46:23
<v MR. BARRASSO>years of this presidency.

1289
00:46:23 --> 00:46:25
<v MR. BARRASSO>so how does that match with what

1290
00:46:25 --> 00:46:28
<v MR. BARRASSO>the President Has been saying?

1291
00:46:28 --> 00:46:30
<v MR. BARRASSO>Well, in February of 2009, the

1292
00:46:30 --> 00:46:31
<v MR. BARRASSO>President Had been President

1293
00:46:31 --> 00:46:32
<v MR. BARRASSO>About a month, he made a

1294
00:46:32 --> 00:46:34
<v MR. BARRASSO>peninsula and the pledge was

1295
00:46:34 --> 00:46:36
<v MR. BARRASSO>that he would cut the deficit in

1296
00:46:36 --> 00:46:37
<v MR. BARRASSO>half by the end of his first

1297
00:46:37 --> 00:46:41
<v MR. BARRASSO>term in office.

1298
00:46:41 --> 00:46:44
<v MR. BARRASSO>Now we lee are -- , here we

1299
00:46:44 --> 00:46:45
<v MR. BARRASSO>are, the final year the

1300
00:46:45 --> 00:46:47
<v MR. BARRASSO>President's first term in

1301
00:46:47 --> 00:46:48
<v MR. BARRASSO>office, and the deficit is

1302
00:46:48 --> 00:46:49
<v MR. BARRASSO>still above a trillion dollars.

1303
00:46:49 --> 00:46:51
<v MR. BARRASSO>Once again what the President

1304
00:46:51 --> 00:46:54
<v MR. BARRASSO>Has said to the american people

1305
00:46:54 --> 00:46:56
<v MR. BARRASSO>is very different than what he

1306
00:46:56 --> 00:46:58
<v MR. BARRASSO>has delivered to the american

1307
00:46:58 --> 00:47:00
<v MR. BARRASSO>people.

1308
00:47:00 --> 00:47:01
<v MR. BARRASSO>And I'm still waiting for a

1309
00:47:01 --> 00:47:03
<v MR. BARRASSO>chance in this body, in the

1310
00:47:03 --> 00:47:04
<v MR. BARRASSO>senate, to vote on the

1311
00:47:04 --> 00:47:06
<v MR. BARRASSO>President's budget.

1312
00:47:06 --> 00:47:08
<v MR. BARRASSO>The majority leader, who sits

1313
00:47:08 --> 00:47:09
<v MR. BARRASSO>in the front row, has said he

1314
00:47:09 --> 00:47:11
<v MR. BARRASSO>doesn't intend to even bring it

1315
00:47:11 --> 00:47:12
<v MR. BARRASSO>to the floor of the united

1316
00:47:12 --> 00:47:15
<v MR. BARRASSO>states senate for a discussion

1317
00:47:15 --> 00:47:16
<v MR. BARRASSO>or a debate or a vote.

1318
00:47:16 --> 00:47:19
<v MR. BARRASSO>The law is pretty clear.

1319
00:47:19 --> 00:47:21
<v MR. BARRASSO>The President Has to introduce a

1320
00:47:21 --> 00:47:22
<v MR. BARRASSO>budget by a certain date, the

1321
00:47:22 --> 00:47:23
<v MR. BARRASSO>President Missed that deadline

1322
00:47:23 --> 00:47:26
<v MR. BARRASSO>and the senate and the house

1323
00:47:26 --> 00:47:28
<v MR. BARRASSO>have to -- have to go ahead and

1324
00:47:28 --> 00:47:32
<v MR. BARRASSO>pass a budget, which this body

1325
00:47:32 --> 00:47:35
<v MR. BARRASSO>has not done now for over a

1326
00:47:35 --> 00:47:36
<v MR. BARRASSO>thousand days.

1327
00:47:36 --> 00:47:38
<v MR. BARRASSO>Multiple years, no budget has

1328
00:47:38 --> 00:47:40
<v MR. BARRASSO>passed this body.

1329
00:47:40 --> 00:47:42
<v MR. BARRASSO>There actually was a vote last

1330
00:47:42 --> 00:47:44
<v MR. BARRASSO>year on the President's budget,

1331
00:47:44 --> 00:47:46
<v MR. BARRASSO>it is one where the budget

1332
00:47:46 --> 00:47:47
<v MR. BARRASSO>itself was called irresponsible

1333
00:47:47 --> 00:47:50
<v MR. BARRASSO>in a number of press renderings

1334
00:47:50 --> 00:47:51
<v MR. BARRASSO>on it, and the majority leader

1335
00:47:51 --> 00:47:54
<v MR. BARRASSO>refused to bring it to the

1336
00:47:54 --> 00:47:55
<v MR. BARRASSO>senate so the minority leader

1337
00:47:55 --> 00:47:57
<v MR. BARRASSO>brought the President's budget

1338
00:47:57 --> 00:48:00
<v MR. BARRASSO>to the senate.

1339
00:48:00 --> 00:48:02
<v MR. BARRASSO>Not one republican voted for it.

1340
00:48:02 --> 00:48:04
<v MR. BARRASSO>But not one democrat voted for

1341
00:48:04 --> 00:48:05
<v MR. BARRASSO>the President's budget, either,

1342
00:48:05 --> 00:48:06
<v MR. BARRASSO>Mr. President.

1343
00:48:06 --> 00:48:07
<v MR. BARRASSO>The total count on the

1344
00:48:07 --> 00:48:09
<v MR. BARRASSO>President's budget last year in

1345
00:48:09 --> 00:48:13
<v MR. BARRASSO>the united states senate, zero

1346
00:48:13 --> 00:48:14
<v MR. BARRASSO>votes for the President's

1347
00:48:14 --> 00:48:16
<v MR. BARRASSO>budget, 97 votes against the

1348
00:48:16 --> 00:48:18
<v MR. BARRASSO>President's budget.

1349
00:48:18 --> 00:48:20
<v MR. BARRASSO>And the President Introduces

1350
00:48:20 --> 00:48:23
<v MR. BARRASSO>another budget this year,

1351
00:48:23 --> 00:48:26
<v MR. BARRASSO>ignoring the two major tidal

1352
00:48:26 --> 00:48:28
<v MR. BARRASSO>waves that we face, the tidal

1353
00:48:28 --> 00:48:28
<v MR. BARRASSO>waves of social security and

1354
00:48:28 --> 00:48:30
<v MR. BARRASSO>medicare.

1355
00:48:30 --> 00:48:33
<v MR. BARRASSO>So it's interesting.

1356
00:48:33 --> 00:48:38
<v MR. BARRASSO>You read in &quot;the new york

1357
00:48:38 --> 00:48:39
<v MR. BARRASSO>times,&quot; obama faces task of

1358
00:48:39 --> 00:48:41
<v MR. BARRASSO>selling dueling budget ideas.

1359
00:48:41 --> 00:48:42
<v MR. BARRASSO>President Obama more than ever

1360
00:48:42 --> 00:48:43
<v MR. BARRASSO>confronts the challenge of

1361
00:48:43 --> 00:48:47
<v MR. BARRASSO>persuading voters that he has a

1362
00:48:47 --> 00:48:47
<v MR. BARRASSO>long-term plan to reduce the

1363
00:48:47 --> 00:48:50
<v MR. BARRASSO>deficit.

1364
00:48:50 --> 00:48:53
<v MR. BARRASSO>Even as he highlights stimulus

1365
00:48:53 --> 00:48:56
<v MR. BARRASSO>spending.

1366
00:48:56 --> 00:48:58
<v MR. BARRASSO>Challenging to persuade voters

1367
00:48:58 --> 00:49:00
<v MR. BARRASSO>that he has a long-term plan to

1368
00:49:00 --> 00:49:02
<v MR. BARRASSO>reduce the deficit.

1369
00:49:02 --> 00:49:03
<v MR. BARRASSO>What did he promise, what did

1370
00:49:03 --> 00:49:05
<v MR. BARRASSO>he deliver.

1371
00:49:05 --> 00:49:07
<v MR. BARRASSO>What we see is health care law

1372
00:49:07 --> 00:49:08
<v MR. BARRASSO>where he promised one thing,

1373
00:49:08 --> 00:49:08
<v MR. BARRASSO>delivered something very

1374
00:49:08 --> 00:49:11
<v MR. BARRASSO>different.

1375
00:49:11 --> 00:49:14
<v MR. BARRASSO>We see it now in the budget.

1376
00:49:14 --> 00:49:16
<v MR. BARRASSO>And the numbers every -- the

1377
00:49:16 --> 00:49:18
<v MR. BARRASSO>numbers are so long-term,

1378
00:49:18 --> 00:49:21
<v MR. BARRASSO>astronomally large that it is

1379
00:49:21 --> 00:49:23
<v MR. BARRASSO>hard for one to comprehend how

1380
00:49:23 --> 00:49:24
<v MR. BARRASSO>much a deficit of a trillion

1381
00:49:24 --> 00:49:26
<v MR. BARRASSO>dollars truly is.

1382
00:49:26 --> 00:49:28
<v MR. BARRASSO>you can visit with high school

1383
00:49:28 --> 00:49:31
<v MR. BARRASSO>students or you visit with

1384
00:49:31 --> 00:49:32
<v MR. BARRASSO>service clubs or a town hall

1385
00:49:32 --> 00:49:35
<v MR. BARRASSO>meeting, senior centers, the

1386
00:49:35 --> 00:49:36
<v MR. BARRASSO>number is so large it's hard to

1387
00:49:36 --> 00:49:38
<v MR. BARRASSO>wrap one's mind around it.

1388
00:49:38 --> 00:49:40
<v MR. BARRASSO>And the President Tries to make

1389
00:49:40 --> 00:49:42
<v MR. BARRASSO>people believe that everything

1390
00:49:42 --> 00:49:44
<v MR. BARRASSO>was okay if he could just raise

1391
00:49:44 --> 00:49:46
<v MR. BARRASSO>some taxes, just a little bit,

1392
00:49:46 --> 00:49:46
<v MR. BARRASSO>he says, on some of the other

1393
00:49:46 --> 00:49:48
<v MR. BARRASSO>people.

1394
00:49:48 --> 00:49:50
<v MR. BARRASSO>Not you, but other people and

1395
00:49:50 --> 00:49:52
<v MR. BARRASSO>everything would be fine.

1396
00:49:52 --> 00:49:54
<v MR. BARRASSO>When you actually look through

1397
00:49:54 --> 00:49:56
<v MR. BARRASSO>this, to get to a trillion

1398
00:49:56 --> 00:49:57
<v MR. BARRASSO>dollars, to get to

1399
00:49:57 --> 00:49:58
<v MR. BARRASSO>$1.3 trillion which is what the

1400
00:49:58 --> 00:50:01
<v MR. BARRASSO>President Has proposed in this

1401
00:50:01 --> 00:50:05
<v MR. BARRASSO>year's budget as a deficit, you

1402
00:50:05 --> 00:50:07
<v MR. BARRASSO>can take all the millionaires,

1403
00:50:07 --> 00:50:09
<v MR. BARRASSO>billionaires, he likes to rail

1404
00:50:09 --> 00:50:12
<v MR. BARRASSO>about, take not just a little

1405
00:50:12 --> 00:50:12
<v MR. BARRASSO>bit, you take every penny they

1406
00:50:12 --> 00:50:14
<v MR. BARRASSO>earn.

1407
00:50:14 --> 00:50:15
<v MR. BARRASSO>Every penny they earn over that

1408
00:50:15 --> 00:50:15
<v MR. BARRASSO>million-dollar.

1409
00:50:15 --> 00:50:18
<v MR. BARRASSO>Every penny.

1410
00:50:18 --> 00:50:21
<v MR. BARRASSO>All of them combined.

1411
00:50:21 --> 00:50:24
<v MR. BARRASSO>And then on top of that sell off

1412
00:50:24 --> 00:50:26
<v MR. BARRASSO>all the gold in fort knox.

1413
00:50:26 --> 00:50:28
<v MR. BARRASSO>All of it.

1414
00:50:28 --> 00:50:29
<v MR. BARRASSO>take all of the money that

1415
00:50:29 --> 00:50:32
<v MR. BARRASSO>people earn over a million

1416
00:50:32 --> 00:50:33
<v MR. BARRASSO>dollars and all the gold in fort

1417
00:50:33 --> 00:50:36
<v MR. BARRASSO>knox, add it all together and

1418
00:50:36 --> 00:50:39
<v MR. BARRASSO>that is not even enough to cover

1419
00:50:39 --> 00:50:41
<v MR. BARRASSO>just the deficit, that trillion

1420
00:50:41 --> 00:50:43
<v MR. BARRASSO>dollars that the President Plans

1421
00:50:43 --> 00:50:44
<v MR. BARRASSO>to spend over and above what

1422
00:50:44 --> 00:50:47
<v MR. BARRASSO>comes in.

1423
00:50:47 --> 00:50:49
<v MR. BARRASSO>it is completely irresponsible,

1424
00:50:49 --> 00:50:49
<v MR. BARRASSO>but that's what we've seen from

1425
00:50:49 --> 00:50:53
<v MR. BARRASSO>this administration.

1426
00:50:53 --> 00:50:55
<v MR. BARRASSO>So we have a President That

1427
00:50:55 --> 00:50:56
<v MR. BARRASSO>makes presentations, gives

1428
00:50:56 --> 00:50:57
<v MR. BARRASSO>speeches, and yet what the

1429
00:50:57 --> 00:50:58
<v MR. BARRASSO>american people see is something

1430
00:50:58 --> 00:50:59
<v MR. BARRASSO>very different.

1431
00:50:59 --> 00:51:00
<v MR. BARRASSO>So this morning in the energy

1432
00:51:01 --> 00:51:03
<v MR. BARRASSO>committee we had an opportunity

1433
00:51:03 --> 00:51:06
<v MR. BARRASSO>to visit with the secretary of

1434
00:51:06 --> 00:51:07
<v MR. BARRASSO>energy specifically on budgetary

1435
00:51:07 --> 00:51:09
<v MR. BARRASSO>issues relating to the budget in

1436
00:51:09 --> 00:51:12
<v MR. BARRASSO>the future and of course the

1437
00:51:12 --> 00:51:14
<v MR. BARRASSO>President Said he supported an

1438
00:51:14 --> 00:51:15
<v MR. BARRASSO>all-of-the-above energy plan for

1439
00:51:15 --> 00:51:17
<v MR. BARRASSO>the country.

1440
00:51:17 --> 00:51:18
<v MR. BARRASSO>Well, I support an

1441
00:51:18 --> 00:51:19
<v MR. BARRASSO>all-of-the-above energy plan for

1442
00:51:19 --> 00:51:20
<v MR. BARRASSO>the country but when you go

1443
00:51:20 --> 00:51:22
<v MR. BARRASSO>through the details, that's not

1444
00:51:22 --> 00:51:23
<v MR. BARRASSO>exactly what the american people

1445
00:51:23 --> 00:51:25
<v MR. BARRASSO>see.

1446
00:51:25 --> 00:51:29
<v MR. BARRASSO>What the american people see is

1447
00:51:29 --> 00:51:30
<v MR. BARRASSO>the cost of gasoline at the pump

1448
00:51:30 --> 00:51:33
<v MR. BARRASSO>continuing to go up.

1449
00:51:33 --> 00:51:36
<v MR. BARRASSO>And they see an administration

1450
00:51:36 --> 00:51:39
<v MR. BARRASSO>that is blocking an opportunity

1451
00:51:39 --> 00:51:41
<v MR. BARRASSO>to move energy, oil, from

1452
00:51:41 --> 00:51:43
<v MR. BARRASSO>northern parts of our country as

1453
00:51:43 --> 00:51:47
<v MR. BARRASSO>well as from canada, to the

1454
00:51:47 --> 00:51:51
<v MR. BARRASSO>united states, for use here.

1455
00:51:51 --> 00:51:53
<v MR. BARRASSO>so take a look the headlines of

1456
00:51:53 --> 00:51:56
<v MR. BARRASSO>front page &quot;usa today&quot; a couple

1457
00:51:56 --> 00:51:57
<v MR. BARRASSO>days ago.

1458
00:51:57 --> 00:51:57
<v MR. BARRASSO>&quot;chaotic spring predicted for

1459
00:51:57 --> 00:52:01
<v MR. BARRASSO>gas.

1460
00:52:01 --> 00:52:02
<v MR. BARRASSO>Average prices likely to hit

1461
00:52:03 --> 00:52:04
<v MR. BARRASSO>$4.05 a gallon.

1462
00:52:04 --> 00:52:06
<v MR. BARRASSO>People care about that.

1463
00:52:06 --> 00:52:08
<v MR. BARRASSO>People all across the country,

1464
00:52:08 --> 00:52:09
<v MR. BARRASSO>they drive around, see the

1465
00:52:10 --> 00:52:11
<v MR. BARRASSO>signs up, and they see what the

1466
00:52:11 --> 00:52:13
<v MR. BARRASSO>cost of a gallon of gasoline is

1467
00:52:13 --> 00:52:15
<v MR. BARRASSO>and they know it and they see it

1468
00:52:15 --> 00:52:17
<v MR. BARRASSO>impacting in their daily lives.

1469
00:52:17 --> 00:52:19
<v MR. BARRASSO>A number of us visited today at

1470
00:52:19 --> 00:52:21
<v MR. BARRASSO>the energy committee and talked

1471
00:52:21 --> 00:52:22
<v MR. BARRASSO>about today's &quot;wall street

1472
00:52:22 --> 00:52:26
<v MR. BARRASSO>journal&quot; article.

1473
00:52:26 --> 00:52:27
<v MR. BARRASSO>This morning, &quot;oil rise and

1474
00:52:27 --> 00:52:29
<v MR. BARRASSO>country's budding recovery.&quot;

1475
00:52:29 --> 00:52:31
<v MR. BARRASSO>we want this country to

1476
00:52:31 --> 00:52:33
<v MR. BARRASSO>recover, get back to work,

1477
00:52:33 --> 00:52:35
<v MR. BARRASSO>cheaper and easier for the

1478
00:52:35 --> 00:52:36
<v MR. BARRASSO>private sector to hire working

1479
00:52:36 --> 00:52:36
<v MR. BARRASSO>people, get america working

1480
00:52:36 --> 00:52:37
<v MR. BARRASSO>again.

1481
00:52:37 --> 00:52:42
<v MR. BARRASSO>The price of energy goes up,

1482
00:52:42 --> 00:52:45
<v MR. BARRASSO>the price of oil goes up, oil

1483
00:52:45 --> 00:52:46
<v MR. BARRASSO>rise imperfectly is -- imperils

1484
00:52:46 --> 00:52:49
<v MR. BARRASSO>budding recovery.

1485
00:52:49 --> 00:52:55
<v MR. BARRASSO>the average price of gasoline,

1486
00:52:55 --> 00:52:58
<v MR. BARRASSO>of regular gasoline has jumped

1487
00:52:58 --> 00:52:59
<v MR. BARRASSO>13.1 cents to $3.51 in the past

1488
00:52:59 --> 00:53:01
<v MR. BARRASSO>month.

1489
00:53:01 --> 00:53:03
<v MR. BARRASSO>So gasoline at the pump up 13

1490
00:53:03 --> 00:53:07
<v MR. BARRASSO>cents in the last month

1491
00:53:07 --> 00:53:08
<v MR. BARRASSO>according to triple a.

1492
00:53:08 --> 00:53:09
<v MR. BARRASSO>Some part of the country have

1493
00:53:09 --> 00:53:12
<v MR. BARRASSO>seen bigger increases with

1494
00:53:12 --> 00:53:14
<v MR. BARRASSO>prices approaching $4 a gallon

1495
00:53:14 --> 00:53:16
<v MR. BARRASSO>in parts of california.

1496
00:53:16 --> 00:53:17
<v MR. BARRASSO>Higher prices at the pump.

1497
00:53:17 --> 00:53:20
<v MR. BARRASSO>And this is where it hits home.

1498
00:53:20 --> 00:53:21
<v MR. BARRASSO>This is what I here about at

1499
00:53:21 --> 00:53:23
<v MR. BARRASSO>home when the price of gasoline

1500
00:53:23 --> 00:53:26
<v MR. BARRASSO>goes up and we drive great

1501
00:53:26 --> 00:53:27
<v MR. BARRASSO>distances in your home,

1502
00:53:27 --> 00:53:29
<v MR. BARRASSO>Mr. President, and my home

1503
00:53:29 --> 00:53:31
<v MR. BARRASSO>state.

1504
00:53:31 --> 00:53:32
<v MR. BARRASSO>it impacts what they can use

1505
00:53:32 --> 00:53:34
<v MR. BARRASSO>that same money for.

1506
00:53:34 --> 00:53:37
<v MR. BARRASSO>As it says in &quot;the wall street

1507
00:53:37 --> 00:53:38
<v MR. BARRASSO>journal&quot; higher prices at the

1508
00:53:38 --> 00:53:42
<v MR. BARRASSO>pump force consumers to cut back

1509
00:53:42 --> 00:53:43
<v MR. BARRASSO>on discretionary spending like

1510
00:53:43 --> 00:53:44
<v MR. BARRASSO>haircuts, family vacations,

1511
00:53:44 --> 00:53:46
<v MR. BARRASSO>hurting those industries.

1512
00:53:46 --> 00:53:48
<v MR. BARRASSO>Isn't that what it's really

1513
00:53:48 --> 00:53:49
<v MR. BARRASSO>about, as the price of gasoline

1514
00:53:49 --> 00:53:52
<v MR. BARRASSO>at the pump goes up, it hurts

1515
00:53:52 --> 00:53:53
<v MR. BARRASSO>the ability of families and the

1516
00:53:53 --> 00:53:55
<v MR. BARRASSO>quality of life so that they can

1517
00:53:55 --> 00:53:57
<v MR. BARRASSO>spend that money in other ways?

1518
00:53:57 --> 00:53:59
<v MR. BARRASSO>As it says, a prolonged

1519
00:53:59 --> 00:54:01
<v MR. BARRASSO>increase can drive up inflation

1520
00:54:01 --> 00:54:02
<v MR. BARRASSO>and drive down hiring.

1521
00:54:02 --> 00:54:03
<v MR. BARRASSO>We're a country that want people

1522
00:54:03 --> 00:54:05
<v MR. BARRASSO>to get back to work.

1523
00:54:05 --> 00:54:05
<v MR. BARRASSO>We want to give those

1524
00:54:05 --> 00:54:08
<v MR. BARRASSO>opportunities and it just seems

1525
00:54:08 --> 00:54:10
<v MR. BARRASSO>that the President's budget and

1526
00:54:10 --> 00:54:11
<v MR. BARRASSO>the policies of this

1527
00:54:11 --> 00:54:12
<v MR. BARRASSO>administration and a rejection

1528
00:54:12 --> 00:54:15
<v MR. BARRASSO>of things that would actually

1529
00:54:15 --> 00:54:18
<v MR. BARRASSO>help us with american energy are

1530
00:54:18 --> 00:54:19
<v MR. BARRASSO>going to make it harder for

1531
00:54:19 --> 00:54:21
<v MR. BARRASSO>families.

1532
00:54:21 --> 00:54:23
<v MR. BARRASSO>When prices of gasoline go up,

1533
00:54:23 --> 00:54:24
<v MR. BARRASSO>the impact on an average

1534
00:54:24 --> 00:54:26
<v MR. BARRASSO>family, over a thousand dollars

1535
00:54:26 --> 00:54:29
<v MR. BARRASSO>a year of impact in terms of

1536
00:54:29 --> 00:54:29
<v MR. BARRASSO>their ability to have disposable

1537
00:54:29 --> 00:54:31
<v MR. BARRASSO>income.

1538
00:54:31 --> 00:54:33
<v MR. BARRASSO>if you're a family dealing with

1539
00:54:33 --> 00:54:35
<v MR. BARRASSO>a mortgage and bills and kids,

1540
00:54:35 --> 00:54:37
<v MR. BARRASSO>that is a huge difference in the

1541
00:54:37 --> 00:54:39
<v MR. BARRASSO>quality of life for those

1542
00:54:39 --> 00:54:40
<v MR. BARRASSO>american families.

1543
00:54:40 --> 00:54:41
<v MR. BARRASSO>You know, states around the

1544
00:54:41 --> 00:54:44
<v MR. BARRASSO>country get it.

1545
00:54:44 --> 00:54:44
<v MR. BARRASSO>I look at wyoming, we're in our

1546
00:54:44 --> 00:54:45
<v MR. BARRASSO>legislative session there right

1547
00:54:45 --> 00:54:47
<v MR. BARRASSO>now.

1548
00:54:47 --> 00:54:48
<v MR. BARRASSO>We balance our budget every

1549
00:54:48 --> 00:54:49
<v MR. BARRASSO>year.

1550
00:54:49 --> 00:54:51
<v MR. BARRASSO>The constitution demands it.

1551
00:54:51 --> 00:54:52
<v MR. BARRASSO>if less money comes in, we

1552
00:54:52 --> 00:54:54
<v MR. BARRASSO>spend less money.

1553
00:54:54 --> 00:54:55
<v MR. BARRASSO>They make the tough decisions.

1554
00:54:56 --> 00:54:57
<v MR. BARRASSO>The President Said he wants to

1555
00:54:57 --> 00:54:59
<v MR. BARRASSO>make -- he's ready to make the

1556
00:54:59 --> 00:54:59
<v MR. BARRASSO>tough decisions, but I don't

1557
00:55:00 --> 00:55:00
<v MR. BARRASSO>see tough decisions in this

1558
00:55:00 --> 00:55:02
<v MR. BARRASSO>budget.

1559
00:55:02 --> 00:55:05
<v MR. BARRASSO>What I see is a political

1560
00:55:05 --> 00:55:07
<v MR. BARRASSO>document, a campaign document,

1561
00:55:07 --> 00:55:09
<v MR. BARRASSO>something that has more stimulus

1562
00:55:09 --> 00:55:11
<v MR. BARRASSO>money in it, money so he can

1563
00:55:11 --> 00:55:14
<v MR. BARRASSO>promise people things.

1564
00:55:14 --> 00:55:15
<v MR. BARRASSO>We all know how that first

1565
00:55:15 --> 00:55:18
<v MR. BARRASSO>so-called stimulus program went.

1566
00:55:18 --> 00:55:22
<v MR. BARRASSO>To me it was a failure.

1567
00:55:22 --> 00:55:23
<v MR. BARRASSO>We have spending on about -- of

1568
00:55:23 --> 00:55:24
<v MR. BARRASSO>about $800 billion.

1569
00:55:24 --> 00:55:27
<v MR. BARRASSO>The President Promised if they

1570
00:55:27 --> 00:55:28
<v MR. BARRASSO>passed the stimulus program,

1571
00:55:28 --> 00:55:30
<v MR. BARRASSO>unemployment rate would stay

1572
00:55:30 --> 00:55:32
<v MR. BARRASSO>less than 8%.

1573
00:55:32 --> 00:55:34
<v MR. BARRASSO>and they put out charts and by

1574
00:55:34 --> 00:55:36
<v MR. BARRASSO>today from those charts, the

1575
00:55:36 --> 00:55:40
<v MR. BARRASSO>unemployment rate should be 6%.

1576
00:55:40 --> 00:55:42
<v MR. BARRASSO>Unemployment rate is still

1577
00:55:42 --> 00:55:44
<v MR. BARRASSO>8.3%, it's been over 8% for 36

1578
00:55:44 --> 00:55:45
<v MR. BARRASSO>months now.

1579
00:55:45 --> 00:55:47
<v MR. BARRASSO>So when you look at this and

1580
00:55:47 --> 00:55:50
<v MR. BARRASSO>look at the President's budget,

1581
00:55:50 --> 00:55:55
<v MR. BARRASSO>to me it's debt on arrival.

1582
00:55:55 --> 00:55:57
<v MR. BARRASSO>the budget spends $47 trillion.

1583
00:55:57 --> 00:56:01
<v MR. BARRASSO>It borrows $11 trillion.

1584
00:56:01 --> 00:56:03
<v MR. BARRASSO>It increases the national debt

1585
00:56:03 --> 00:56:07
<v MR. BARRASSO>to $26 trillion by 2022.

1586
00:56:07 --> 00:56:09
<v MR. BARRASSO>It is debt upon debt upon debt.

1587
00:56:09 --> 00:56:09
<v MR. BARRASSO>So where do you borrow the money

1588
00:56:09 --> 00:56:11
<v MR. BARRASSO>from?

1589
00:56:11 --> 00:56:12
<v MR. BARRASSO>A lot of it you borrow from

1590
00:56:12 --> 00:56:12
<v MR. BARRASSO>overseas, a lot of it from

1591
00:56:12 --> 00:56:14
<v MR. BARRASSO>china.

1592
00:56:14 --> 00:56:15
<v MR. BARRASSO>So what role is china playing

1593
00:56:15 --> 00:56:17
<v MR. BARRASSO>now?

1594
00:56:17 --> 00:56:18
<v MR. BARRASSO>They're continuing to lend ups

1595
00:56:18 --> 00:56:21
<v MR. BARRASSO>money and, by the way, when the

1596
00:56:21 --> 00:56:23
<v MR. BARRASSO>President Blocked the keystone

1597
00:56:23 --> 00:56:25
<v MR. BARRASSO>X.L. Pipeline what did china say

1598
00:56:25 --> 00:56:27
<v MR. BARRASSO>to our northern neighbors, our

1599
00:56:27 --> 00:56:27
<v MR. BARRASSO>trading partners, the united

1600
00:56:27 --> 00:56:29
<v MR. BARRASSO>states doesn't want it,

1601
00:56:29 --> 00:56:29
<v MR. BARRASSO>President Obama isn't

1602
00:56:29 --> 00:56:31
<v MR. BARRASSO>interested, we'll take the oil

1603
00:56:31 --> 00:56:32
<v MR. BARRASSO>in china.

1604
00:56:32 --> 00:56:35
<v MR. BARRASSO>the prime minister of canada was

1605
00:56:35 --> 00:56:35
<v MR. BARRASSO>in china last week, doing

1606
00:56:35 --> 00:56:37
<v MR. BARRASSO>exactly that.

1607
00:56:37 --> 00:56:40
<v MR. BARRASSO>Cutting a deal with the chinese

1608
00:56:40 --> 00:56:42
<v MR. BARRASSO>for energy that will be sold

1609
00:56:42 --> 00:56:44
<v MR. BARRASSO>from canada, I think we should

1610
00:56:44 --> 00:56:46
<v MR. BARRASSO>want it, I think if we want to

1611
00:56:46 --> 00:56:47
<v MR. BARRASSO>be energy secure and work on

1612
00:56:47 --> 00:56:49
<v MR. BARRASSO>energy security which to me is

1613
00:56:49 --> 00:56:52
<v MR. BARRASSO>an issue of national security,

1614
00:56:52 --> 00:56:55
<v MR. BARRASSO>we should want that energy.

1615
00:56:55 --> 00:56:56
<v MR. BARRASSO>good jobs, the amount of money

1616
00:56:56 --> 00:56:56
<v MR. BARRASSO>in terms of jobs that's

1617
00:56:56 --> 00:56:58
<v MR. BARRASSO>available.

1618
00:56:58 --> 00:56:59
<v MR. BARRASSO>This isn't government money,

1619
00:56:59 --> 00:57:00
<v MR. BARRASSO>private money to put those

1620
00:57:00 --> 00:57:02
<v MR. BARRASSO>people back to work.

1621
00:57:02 --> 00:57:03
<v MR. BARRASSO>We haven't seen it.

1622
00:57:03 --> 00:57:05
<v MR. BARRASSO>And this administration through

1623
00:57:05 --> 00:57:08
<v MR. BARRASSO>its budget and through its

1624
00:57:08 --> 00:57:10
<v MR. BARRASSO>policies continue to oppose

1625
00:57:10 --> 00:57:13
<v MR. BARRASSO>those efforts for american jobs.

1626
00:57:13 --> 00:57:16
<v MR. BARRASSO>so what we see is spending --

1627
00:57:16 --> 00:57:17
<v MR. BARRASSO>is spending goes up under the

1628
00:57:17 --> 00:57:18
<v MR. BARRASSO>President's 10-year budget

1629
00:57:18 --> 00:57:19
<v MR. BARRASSO>proposal, the spending goes up

1630
00:57:19 --> 00:57:21
<v MR. BARRASSO>every year without stop.

1631
00:57:21 --> 00:57:22
<v MR. BARRASSO>Every year from now over the

1632
00:57:22 --> 00:57:23
<v MR. BARRASSO>next ten years, spending goes

1633
00:57:23 --> 00:57:26
<v MR. BARRASSO>up.

1634
00:57:26 --> 00:57:28
<v MR. BARRASSO>And we see trillion-dollar

1635
00:57:28 --> 00:57:30
<v MR. BARRASSO>deficits year after year after

1636
00:57:30 --> 00:57:33
<v MR. BARRASSO>year.

1637
00:57:33 --> 00:57:35
<v MR. BARRASSO>and one of the most disturbing

1638
00:57:35 --> 00:57:38
<v MR. BARRASSO>things to some of my colleagues

1639
00:57:38 --> 00:57:41
<v MR. BARRASSO>who have accounting degrees

1640
00:57:41 --> 00:57:43
<v MR. BARRASSO>especially my senior senator

1641
00:57:43 --> 00:57:45
<v MR. BARRASSO>from the state of wyoming who

1642
00:57:45 --> 00:57:48
<v MR. BARRASSO>looks at businesses, who looks

1643
00:57:48 --> 00:57:49
<v MR. BARRASSO>at this and can point out

1644
00:57:49 --> 00:57:50
<v MR. BARRASSO>easily, the budgetary

1645
00:57:50 --> 00:57:52
<v MR. BARRASSO>gimmicks, the accounting tricks

1646
00:57:52 --> 00:57:55
<v MR. BARRASSO>that have been used over and

1647
00:57:55 --> 00:57:56
<v MR. BARRASSO>over again to make this budget

1648
00:57:56 --> 00:57:59
<v MR. BARRASSO>as irresponsible as it happens

1649
00:57:59 --> 00:58:03
<v MR. BARRASSO>to be, to try to make it look

1650
00:58:03 --> 00:58:06
<v MR. BARRASSO>not as bad as it really is.

1651
00:58:06 --> 00:58:08
<v MR. BARRASSO>This budget is bad for america,

1652
00:58:08 --> 00:58:09
<v MR. BARRASSO>and it is a continuation of a

1653
00:58:09 --> 00:58:11
<v MR. BARRASSO>number of policies that have

1654
00:58:11 --> 00:58:14
<v MR. BARRASSO>come out of this administration

1655
00:58:14 --> 00:58:16
<v MR. BARRASSO>that have made it harder and

1656
00:58:16 --> 00:58:18
<v MR. BARRASSO>more expensive for the private

1657
00:58:18 --> 00:58:18
<v MR. BARRASSO>sector to create jobs in this

1658
00:58:18 --> 00:58:20
<v MR. BARRASSO>country.

1659
00:58:20 --> 00:58:21
<v MR. BARRASSO>And what I'm trying to do is

1660
00:58:21 --> 00:58:24
<v MR. BARRASSO>look for ways to make it easier

1661
00:58:24 --> 00:58:27
<v MR. BARRASSO>and cheaper for the private

1662
00:58:27 --> 00:58:28
<v MR. BARRASSO>sector to create jobs in this

1663
00:58:28 --> 00:58:29
<v MR. BARRASSO>country.

1664
00:58:29 --> 00:58:30
<v MR. BARRASSO>We have not seen it in the

1665
00:58:30 --> 00:58:31
<v MR. BARRASSO>President's budget.

1666
00:58:31 --> 00:58:33
<v MR. BARRASSO>We have not seen it in the

1667
00:58:33 --> 00:58:36
<v MR. BARRASSO>policies of this administration.

1668
00:58:36 --> 00:58:36
<v MR. BARRASSO>we have not seen it in this

1669
00:58:36 --> 00:58:37
<v MR. BARRASSO>President.

1670
00:58:37 --> 00:58:38
<v MR. BARRASSO>Thank you very much,

1671
00:58:38 --> 00:58:44
<v MR. BARRASSO>Mr. President.

1672
00:58:44 --> 00:58:45
<v MR. BARRASSO>I yield the floor.

1673
00:58:45 --> 00:58:45
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

1674
00:58:45 --> 00:58:47
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senator from vermont is

1675
00:58:47 --> 00:58:48
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>recognized.

1676
00:58:48 --> 00:58:51
<v MR. LEAHY>Mr. President, I ask

1677
00:58:51 --> 00:58:52
<v MR. LEAHY>consent to speak for up to ten

1678
00:58:52 --> 00:58:53
<v MR. LEAHY>minutes as in morning business.

1679
00:58:53 --> 00:58:55
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

1680
00:58:55 --> 00:58:55
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

1681
00:58:56 --> 00:59:04
<v MR. LEAHY>thank you,

1682
00:59:04 --> 00:59:07
<v MR. LEAHY>Mr. President.

1683
00:59:07 --> 00:59:09
<v MR. LEAHY>You know, in a way I'm almost

1684
00:59:09 --> 00:59:11
<v MR. LEAHY>reluctant to say this because it

1685
00:59:11 --> 00:59:14
<v MR. LEAHY>also just points to one of the

1686
00:59:14 --> 00:59:16
<v MR. LEAHY>reasons why so many people

1687
00:59:16 --> 00:59:18
<v MR. LEAHY>wonder if congress has just

1688
00:59:18 --> 00:59:20
<v MR. LEAHY>become totally dysfunctional,

1689
00:59:20 --> 00:59:21
<v MR. LEAHY>but I looked at how the senate

1690
00:59:21 --> 00:59:25
<v MR. LEAHY>was forced to spend the better

1691
00:59:25 --> 00:59:26
<v MR. LEAHY>part of this week ending a

1692
00:59:26 --> 00:59:29
<v MR. LEAHY>filibuster against the

1693
00:59:29 --> 00:59:33
<v MR. LEAHY>nomination of judge adalberto

1694
00:59:33 --> 00:59:36
<v MR. LEAHY>jordan of florida to fill a

1695
00:59:36 --> 00:59:37
<v MR. LEAHY>judicial emergency vacancy on

1696
00:59:38 --> 00:59:42
<v MR. LEAHY>the 11th circuit.

1697
00:59:42 --> 00:59:46
<v MR. LEAHY>Finally we had a four-month

1698
00:59:46 --> 00:59:49
<v MR. LEAHY>filibuster, republican

1699
00:59:49 --> 00:59:53
<v MR. LEAHY>filibuster, on this judge.

1700
00:59:53 --> 00:59:56
<v MR. LEAHY>I would note that within hours

1701
00:59:56 --> 00:59:58
<v MR. LEAHY>of him being reported

1702
00:59:58 --> 01:00:01
<v MR. LEAHY>unanimously out of the senate

1703
01:00:01 --> 01:00:03
<v MR. LEAHY>judiciary committee four months

1704
01:00:03 --> 01:00:04
<v MR. LEAHY>ago, democrats, every single

1705
01:00:04 --> 01:00:06
<v MR. LEAHY>democrat said they're prepared

1706
01:00:06 --> 01:00:07
<v MR. LEAHY>to go for a vote on him

1707
01:00:07 --> 01:00:09
<v MR. LEAHY>immediately.

1708
01:00:09 --> 01:00:11
<v MR. LEAHY>For four months he was held up

1709
01:00:11 --> 01:00:15
<v MR. LEAHY>by a republican filibuster, we

1710
01:00:15 --> 01:00:17
<v MR. LEAHY>broke it on monday by an 89-5

1711
01:00:17 --> 01:00:19
<v MR. LEAHY>cloture vote and even then

1712
01:00:19 --> 01:00:21
<v MR. LEAHY>republicans invis cysted on

1713
01:00:21 --> 01:00:23
<v MR. LEAHY>another two -- insisted on

1714
01:00:23 --> 01:00:25
<v MR. LEAHY>another two additional delays on

1715
01:00:25 --> 01:00:26
<v MR. LEAHY>this good man.

1716
01:00:26 --> 01:00:28
<v MR. LEAHY>Finally the senate was allowed

1717
01:00:28 --> 01:00:30
<v MR. LEAHY>to vote on him.

1718
01:00:30 --> 01:00:36
<v MR. LEAHY>When we are were allowed to vote

1719
01:00:36 --> 01:00:38
<v MR. LEAHY>on him, we confirmed him 94-5.

1720
01:00:38 --> 01:00:40
<v MR. LEAHY>You know, if we had had voted

1721
01:00:40 --> 01:00:41
<v MR. LEAHY>on him four months and two days

1722
01:00:41 --> 01:00:43
<v MR. LEAHY>earlier when we wanted to, the

1723
01:00:43 --> 01:00:46
<v MR. LEAHY>vote would have been the same.

1724
01:00:46 --> 01:00:48
<v MR. LEAHY>It was a colossal waste of the

1725
01:00:48 --> 01:00:51
<v MR. LEAHY>senate's time, a colossal waste

1726
01:00:51 --> 01:00:56
<v MR. LEAHY>of america's time, another week

1727
01:00:56 --> 01:00:57
<v MR. LEAHY>lost to obstruction and delay.

1728
01:00:57 --> 01:00:59
<v MR. LEAHY>Now the senate majority leader

1729
01:00:59 --> 01:01:01
<v MR. LEAHY>has been required to file

1730
01:01:01 --> 01:01:02
<v MR. LEAHY>another cloture petition on yet

1731
01:01:02 --> 01:01:05
<v MR. LEAHY>another consensus nominee.

1732
01:01:05 --> 01:01:07
<v MR. LEAHY>This is the ninth time the

1733
01:01:07 --> 01:01:09
<v MR. LEAHY>majority leader has had to file

1734
01:01:09 --> 01:01:11
<v MR. LEAHY>a cloture petition to overcome a

1735
01:01:11 --> 01:01:13
<v MR. LEAHY>republican filibuster on one of

1736
01:01:13 --> 01:01:15
<v MR. LEAHY>President Obama's superbly

1737
01:01:15 --> 01:01:18
<v MR. LEAHY>callified judicial nominees.

1738
01:01:18 --> 01:01:20
<v MR. LEAHY>the nomination of jesse furman

1739
01:01:20 --> 01:01:22
<v MR. LEAHY>to fill a vacancy in the

1740
01:01:22 --> 01:01:25
<v MR. LEAHY>southern district of inspector

1741
01:01:25 --> 01:01:27
<v MR. LEAHY>has been stalled more than five

1742
01:01:27 --> 01:01:28
<v MR. LEAHY>months after being reported

1743
01:01:28 --> 01:01:29
<v MR. LEAHY>unanimously from the senate

1744
01:01:29 --> 01:01:31
<v MR. LEAHY>judiciary committee.

1745
01:01:31 --> 01:01:33
<v MR. LEAHY>So the first four months on the

1746
01:01:33 --> 01:01:36
<v MR. LEAHY>first cuban american to go on

1747
01:01:36 --> 01:01:39
<v MR. LEAHY>the 11th circuit, he was

1748
01:01:39 --> 01:01:39
<v MR. LEAHY>stalled by republicans for four

1749
01:01:39 --> 01:01:41
<v MR. LEAHY>months.

1750
01:01:41 --> 01:01:45
<v MR. LEAHY>Now we have somebody being

1751
01:01:45 --> 01:01:47
<v MR. LEAHY>stalled for five months.

1752
01:01:47 --> 01:01:49
<v MR. LEAHY>In the past, when somebody has

1753
01:01:49 --> 01:01:51
<v MR. LEAHY>been reported unanimously every

1754
01:01:51 --> 01:01:53
<v MR. LEAHY>single republican, every single

1755
01:01:53 --> 01:01:56
<v MR. LEAHY>democrat voting for them on the

1756
01:01:56 --> 01:01:58
<v MR. LEAHY>judiciary committee, we consider

1757
01:01:58 --> 01:02:00
<v MR. LEAHY>them consensus nominations, and

1758
01:02:00 --> 01:02:01
<v MR. LEAHY>they usually have been taken up

1759
01:02:01 --> 01:02:02
<v MR. LEAHY>and confirmed by the senate

1760
01:02:02 --> 01:02:03
<v MR. LEAHY>within days or weeks.

1761
01:02:03 --> 01:02:05
<v MR. LEAHY>We have done this whether we

1762
01:02:05 --> 01:02:06
<v MR. LEAHY>have had a democratic or

1763
01:02:06 --> 01:02:08
<v MR. LEAHY>republican President.

1764
01:02:08 --> 01:02:12
<v MR. LEAHY>Certainly, this was the approach

1765
01:02:12 --> 01:02:17
<v MR. LEAHY>taken by senate democrats when

1766
01:02:17 --> 01:02:18
<v MR. LEAHY>President Obama sent his con

1767
01:02:18 --> 01:02:19
<v MR. LEAHY>sense nominees.

1768
01:02:19 --> 01:02:21
<v MR. LEAHY>They were able to move the 17

1769
01:02:21 --> 01:02:22
<v MR. LEAHY>months the democrats were

1770
01:02:22 --> 01:02:25
<v MR. LEAHY>charged during the President's

1771
01:02:25 --> 01:02:28
<v MR. LEAHY>first term in office, we moved

1772
01:02:28 --> 01:02:29
<v MR. LEAHY>100 -- successfully, 100 of his

1773
01:02:29 --> 01:02:31
<v MR. LEAHY>judges, even though they were

1774
01:02:31 --> 01:02:35
<v MR. LEAHY>not people that would have been

1775
01:02:35 --> 01:02:36
<v MR. LEAHY>probably nominated by a

1776
01:02:36 --> 01:02:39
<v MR. LEAHY>democratic President.

1777
01:02:39 --> 01:02:39
<v MR. LEAHY>we thought he would work for

1778
01:02:39 --> 01:02:41
<v MR. LEAHY>consensus, removed them.

1779
01:02:41 --> 01:02:43
<v MR. LEAHY>But in an almost complete

1780
01:02:43 --> 01:02:48
<v MR. LEAHY>reversal of what we did for

1781
01:02:48 --> 01:02:48
<v MR. LEAHY>President Bush, Mr. Furman's

1782
01:02:48 --> 01:02:50
<v MR. LEAHY>nomination by President Obama

1783
01:02:50 --> 01:02:51
<v MR. LEAHY>has been blocked by senate

1784
01:02:51 --> 01:02:57
<v MR. LEAHY>republicans for five months

1785
01:02:57 --> 01:02:59
<v MR. LEAHY>without reason or explanation.

1786
01:02:59 --> 01:03:03
<v MR. LEAHY>did it cross anybody's mind why

1787
01:03:03 --> 01:03:04
<v MR. LEAHY>the american people look at what

1788
01:03:04 --> 01:03:06
<v MR. LEAHY>this kind of republican

1789
01:03:06 --> 01:03:08
<v MR. LEAHY>obstruction and wonder what in

1790
01:03:08 --> 01:03:10
<v MR. LEAHY>heaven's name is the congress

1791
01:03:10 --> 01:03:12
<v MR. LEAHY>doing?

1792
01:03:12 --> 01:03:13
<v MR. LEAHY>And regrettably, for the second

1793
01:03:13 --> 01:03:14
<v MR. LEAHY>time, we have to vote to end a

1794
01:03:14 --> 01:03:18
<v MR. LEAHY>republican filibuster of one of

1795
01:03:18 --> 01:03:20
<v MR. LEAHY>President Obama's district court

1796
01:03:20 --> 01:03:22
<v MR. LEAHY>nominations.

1797
01:03:22 --> 01:03:23
<v MR. LEAHY>I cannot recall a single

1798
01:03:23 --> 01:03:24
<v MR. LEAHY>instance in which the

1799
01:03:24 --> 01:03:26
<v MR. LEAHY>President's judicial nomination

1800
01:03:26 --> 01:03:29
<v MR. LEAHY>to a federal trial court,

1801
01:03:29 --> 01:03:30
<v MR. LEAHY>federal district court was

1802
01:03:30 --> 01:03:32
<v MR. LEAHY>blocked by a filibuster.

1803
01:03:32 --> 01:03:35
<v MR. LEAHY>And yet, senate republicans

1804
01:03:35 --> 01:03:37
<v MR. LEAHY>nearly did last year when they

1805
01:03:37 --> 01:03:38
<v MR. LEAHY>sought to filibuster judge jack

1806
01:03:38 --> 01:03:40
<v MR. LEAHY>Mcconnell's nomination to the

1807
01:03:40 --> 01:03:41
<v MR. LEAHY>rhode island district court

1808
01:03:41 --> 01:03:43
<v MR. LEAHY>despite the strong support of

1809
01:03:43 --> 01:03:46
<v MR. LEAHY>both home state senators who

1810
01:03:47 --> 01:03:48
<v MR. LEAHY>know their state best.

1811
01:03:48 --> 01:03:53
<v MR. LEAHY>At that time I emphasized the

1812
01:03:53 --> 01:03:55
<v MR. LEAHY>danger of rejecting the senate's

1813
01:03:55 --> 01:03:56
<v MR. LEAHY>traditional deference to home

1814
01:03:56 --> 01:03:58
<v MR. LEAHY>state senators and began to

1815
01:03:58 --> 01:03:59
<v MR. LEAHY>filibuster district court

1816
01:03:59 --> 01:04:00
<v MR. LEAHY>nominations.

1817
01:04:00 --> 01:04:01
<v MR. LEAHY>now, fortunately, the senate

1818
01:04:01 --> 01:04:04
<v MR. LEAHY>rejected that filibuster and

1819
01:04:04 --> 01:04:05
<v MR. LEAHY>judge Mcconnell was confirmed

1820
01:04:05 --> 01:04:12
<v MR. LEAHY>overwhelmingly.

1821
01:04:12 --> 01:04:16
<v MR. LEAHY>But like the needless delay in

1822
01:04:16 --> 01:04:18
<v MR. LEAHY>judge jordan's confirmation, the

1823
01:04:18 --> 01:04:19
<v MR. LEAHY>first cuban american to the

1824
01:04:19 --> 01:04:21
<v MR. LEAHY>circuit, the republican

1825
01:04:21 --> 01:04:23
<v MR. LEAHY>filibuster of jesse furman by

1826
01:04:23 --> 01:04:24
<v MR. LEAHY>any traditional measure as a

1827
01:04:24 --> 01:04:26
<v MR. LEAHY>consensus nominee is just

1828
01:04:26 --> 01:04:30
<v MR. LEAHY>another example of the tactics

1829
01:04:30 --> 01:04:31
<v MR. LEAHY>that have all but paralyzed the

1830
01:04:31 --> 01:04:33
<v MR. LEAHY>senate confirmation process but

1831
01:04:33 --> 01:04:34
<v MR. LEAHY>are also damaging, seriously

1832
01:04:34 --> 01:04:38
<v MR. LEAHY>damaging our federal courts by

1833
01:04:38 --> 01:04:38
<v MR. LEAHY>this kind of obstruction by the

1834
01:04:38 --> 01:04:41
<v MR. LEAHY>republicans.

1835
01:04:41 --> 01:04:44
<v MR. LEAHY>it should not take five months

1836
01:04:44 --> 01:04:46
<v MR. LEAHY>and require a cloture motion for

1837
01:04:46 --> 01:04:47
<v MR. LEAHY>the senate to proceed to vote on

1838
01:04:47 --> 01:04:48
<v MR. LEAHY>this nomination.

1839
01:04:48 --> 01:04:50
<v MR. LEAHY>You have to remember,

1840
01:04:50 --> 01:04:52
<v MR. LEAHY>Mr. President, nearly one out of

1841
01:04:52 --> 01:04:56
<v MR. LEAHY>every ten judgeships is vacant.

1842
01:04:56 --> 01:04:58
<v MR. LEAHY>We have over 20 judicial

1843
01:04:58 --> 01:05:01
<v MR. LEAHY>nominations that were reported

1844
01:05:01 --> 01:05:04
<v MR. LEAHY>favorably by the committee.

1845
01:05:04 --> 01:05:06
<v MR. LEAHY>16 of them have been stalled on

1846
01:05:06 --> 01:05:07
<v MR. LEAHY>the senate calendar since last

1847
01:05:07 --> 01:05:10
<v MR. LEAHY>year.

1848
01:05:10 --> 01:05:13
<v MR. LEAHY>Nearly all of them superbly

1849
01:05:13 --> 01:05:17
<v MR. LEAHY>qualified consensus nominees.

1850
01:05:17 --> 01:05:19
<v MR. LEAHY>We have to ask what are they

1851
01:05:19 --> 01:05:23
<v MR. LEAHY>thinking in doing this?

1852
01:05:23 --> 01:05:25
<v MR. LEAHY>why are they willing to hurt our

1853
01:05:25 --> 01:05:27
<v MR. LEAHY>federal courts, our american

1854
01:05:27 --> 01:05:27
<v MR. LEAHY>people by these partisan

1855
01:05:27 --> 01:05:30
<v MR. LEAHY>tactics?

1856
01:05:30 --> 01:05:35
<v MR. LEAHY>You know, I read with interest

1857
01:05:35 --> 01:05:36
<v MR. LEAHY>this morning gail collins, a

1858
01:05:36 --> 01:05:37
<v MR. LEAHY>columnist of the &quot;new york

1859
01:05:37 --> 01:05:38
<v MR. LEAHY>times.&quot;

1860
01:05:38 --> 01:05:39
<v MR. LEAHY>she spoke of the approval rating

1861
01:05:39 --> 01:05:41
<v MR. LEAHY>of congress.

1862
01:05:41 --> 01:05:47
<v MR. LEAHY>she notes that congress is

1863
01:05:47 --> 01:05:51
<v MR. LEAHY>unpopular like the bolla virus

1864
01:05:51 --> 01:05:53
<v MR. LEAHY>or zombies or tv shows about

1865
01:05:53 --> 01:05:55
<v MR. LEAHY>hoarders with dead cats in their

1866
01:05:55 --> 01:05:58
<v MR. LEAHY>kitchens.

1867
01:05:58 --> 01:06:00
<v MR. LEAHY>Well, that about sums it up.

1868
01:06:00 --> 01:06:01
<v MR. LEAHY>Ms. Collins goes on to discuss

1869
01:06:01 --> 01:06:03
<v MR. LEAHY>republican filibusters to

1870
01:06:03 --> 01:06:06
<v MR. LEAHY>judicial nominees and writes --

1871
01:06:06 --> 01:06:08
<v MR. LEAHY>&quot;this week the senate confirmed

1872
01:06:08 --> 01:06:10
<v MR. LEAHY>judge adalberto jose jordan to a

1873
01:06:10 --> 01:06:11
<v MR. LEAHY>seat on the federal court of

1874
01:06:11 --> 01:06:12
<v MR. LEAHY>appeals for the 11th circuit

1875
01:06:12 --> 01:06:13
<v MR. LEAHY>in atlanta.

1876
01:06:13 --> 01:06:15
<v MR. LEAHY>A visitor from another country

1877
01:06:15 --> 01:06:19
<v MR. LEAHY>might not have appreciated the

1878
01:06:19 --> 01:06:22
<v MR. LEAHY>proportions of this achievement,

1879
01:06:22 --> 01:06:26
<v MR. LEAHY>given that jordan was born in

1880
01:06:26 --> 01:06:29
<v MR. LEAHY>cuba and once clerked for

1881
01:06:29 --> 01:06:30
<v MR. LEAHY>senator day o'connor and are no

1882
01:06:30 --> 01:06:37
<v MR. LEAHY>discernible opposition.&quot;

1883
01:06:37 --> 01:06:38
<v MR. LEAHY>close quote.

1884
01:06:38 --> 01:06:39
<v MR. LEAHY>But he was blocked in his way

1885
01:06:39 --> 01:06:43
<v MR. LEAHY>since last year.

1886
01:06:43 --> 01:06:46
<v MR. LEAHY>i ask that a copy of

1887
01:06:46 --> 01:06:48
<v MR. LEAHY>Ms. Collins' column be included

1888
01:06:48 --> 01:06:48
<v MR. LEAHY>in the record at the end of my

1889
01:06:48 --> 01:06:49
<v MR. LEAHY>remarks.

1890
01:06:49 --> 01:06:50
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

1891
01:06:50 --> 01:06:50
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

1892
01:06:50 --> 01:06:51
<v MR. LEAHY>I don't know how you

1893
01:06:51 --> 01:06:53
<v MR. LEAHY>explain to the american people

1894
01:06:53 --> 01:06:57
<v MR. LEAHY>this kind of obstruction.

1895
01:06:57 --> 01:06:59
<v MR. LEAHY>This republican filibuster of a

1896
01:06:59 --> 01:07:00
<v MR. LEAHY>cuban american is very hard to

1897
01:07:00 --> 01:07:01
<v MR. LEAHY>understand, especially when he

1898
01:07:01 --> 01:07:03
<v MR. LEAHY>had the support of both the

1899
01:07:03 --> 01:07:04
<v MR. LEAHY>senators from his home state,

1900
01:07:04 --> 01:07:05
<v MR. LEAHY>one a democrat, one a

1901
01:07:05 --> 01:07:08
<v MR. LEAHY>republican.

1902
01:07:08 --> 01:07:10
<v MR. LEAHY>In this case, we have jesse

1903
01:07:10 --> 01:07:12
<v MR. LEAHY>furman, an experienced federal

1904
01:07:12 --> 01:07:13
<v MR. LEAHY>prosecutor, who has prosecuted

1905
01:07:13 --> 01:07:14
<v MR. LEAHY>international narcotics

1906
01:07:14 --> 01:07:15
<v MR. LEAHY>trafficking and terrorism.

1907
01:07:15 --> 01:07:17
<v MR. LEAHY>He has consulted in some of the

1908
01:07:17 --> 01:07:20
<v MR. LEAHY>southern district's most complex

1909
01:07:20 --> 01:07:23
<v MR. LEAHY>cases, including the galleon

1910
01:07:23 --> 01:07:25
<v MR. LEAHY>insider trading case, the

1911
01:07:25 --> 01:07:27
<v MR. LEAHY>prosecution of former madoff

1912
01:07:27 --> 01:07:28
<v MR. LEAHY>employees and the times square

1913
01:07:28 --> 01:07:32
<v MR. LEAHY>bomber case.

1914
01:07:32 --> 01:07:33
<v MR. LEAHY>A dedicated public servant,

1915
01:07:33 --> 01:07:34
<v MR. LEAHY>Mr. Furman has been a law clerk

1916
01:07:34 --> 01:07:36
<v MR. LEAHY>at all three levels of the

1917
01:07:36 --> 01:07:38
<v MR. LEAHY>federal judiciary, including as

1918
01:07:38 --> 01:07:39
<v MR. LEAHY>a clerk to supreme court justice

1919
01:07:39 --> 01:07:42
<v MR. LEAHY>david souter.

1920
01:07:42 --> 01:07:44
<v MR. LEAHY>Now, I got to know Mr. Furman

1921
01:07:44 --> 01:07:45
<v MR. LEAHY>when he was counselor to

1922
01:07:45 --> 01:07:46
<v MR. LEAHY>attorney general michael

1923
01:07:46 --> 01:07:47
<v MR. LEAHY>mukasey.

1924
01:07:47 --> 01:07:49
<v MR. LEAHY>That's right, the senate

1925
01:07:49 --> 01:07:50
<v MR. LEAHY>republicans are filibustering

1926
01:07:50 --> 01:07:53
<v MR. LEAHY>somebody strongly supported by

1927
01:07:53 --> 01:07:56
<v MR. LEAHY>President Bush's attorney

1928
01:07:56 --> 01:07:56
<v MR. LEAHY>general who is himself a federal

1929
01:07:56 --> 01:07:59
<v MR. LEAHY>judge.

1930
01:07:59 --> 01:08:00
<v MR. LEAHY>In fact, when Mr. Furman's

1931
01:08:00 --> 01:08:02
<v MR. LEAHY>nomination went before the

1932
01:08:02 --> 01:08:04
<v MR. LEAHY>committee way last year,

1933
01:08:04 --> 01:08:05
<v MR. LEAHY>attorney general mukasey wrote

1934
01:08:05 --> 01:08:06
<v MR. LEAHY>to the attorney general in

1935
01:08:06 --> 01:08:07
<v MR. LEAHY>strong support.

1936
01:08:07 --> 01:08:10
<v MR. LEAHY>Former supreme court clerks who

1937
01:08:10 --> 01:08:11
<v MR. LEAHY>served at the same time as

1938
01:08:11 --> 01:08:12
<v MR. LEAHY>Mr. Furman including clerks for

1939
01:08:12 --> 01:08:14
<v MR. LEAHY>conservative justices, chief

1940
01:08:14 --> 01:08:16
<v MR. LEAHY>justice rehnquist, justice

1941
01:08:16 --> 01:08:19
<v MR. LEAHY>thomas and justice scalia wrote

1942
01:08:19 --> 01:08:21
<v MR. LEAHY>in support of Mr. Furman's

1943
01:08:21 --> 01:08:22
<v MR. LEAHY>nomination, stating that

1944
01:08:22 --> 01:08:23
<v MR. LEAHY>Mr. Furman has demonstrated his

1945
01:08:23 --> 01:08:25
<v MR. LEAHY>deep respect for and commitment

1946
01:08:25 --> 01:08:30
<v MR. LEAHY>to the rule of law over and

1947
01:08:30 --> 01:08:31
<v MR. LEAHY>above politics and ideology.

1948
01:08:31 --> 01:08:33
<v MR. LEAHY>Now, this bipartisan support,

1949
01:08:33 --> 01:08:36
<v MR. LEAHY>the strong support of his home

1950
01:08:36 --> 01:08:37
<v MR. LEAHY>state senators, his impressive

1951
01:08:37 --> 01:08:38
<v MR. LEAHY>background.

1952
01:08:38 --> 01:08:39
<v MR. LEAHY>Mr. Furman's nomination was

1953
01:08:39 --> 01:08:43
<v MR. LEAHY>reported by the judiciary

1954
01:08:43 --> 01:08:43
<v MR. LEAHY>committee last year in

1955
01:08:43 --> 01:08:45
<v MR. LEAHY>September.

1956
01:08:45 --> 01:08:46
<v MR. LEAHY>without opposition from sainl

1957
01:08:46 --> 01:08:48
<v MR. LEAHY>member, republican or democratic

1958
01:08:48 --> 01:08:49
<v MR. LEAHY>from the committee.

1959
01:08:49 --> 01:08:54
<v MR. LEAHY>Now, we should have voted on

1960
01:08:54 --> 01:08:56
<v MR. LEAHY>this nomination months ago, but

1961
01:08:56 --> 01:08:58
<v MR. LEAHY>he had been blocked by senate

1962
01:08:58 --> 01:09:00
<v MR. LEAHY>republicans for over five months

1963
01:09:00 --> 01:09:04
<v MR. LEAHY>with no explanation.

1964
01:09:04 --> 01:09:06
<v MR. LEAHY>of course, this is not the first

1965
01:09:06 --> 01:09:07
<v MR. LEAHY>new york judge to be

1966
01:09:07 --> 01:09:08
<v MR. LEAHY>filibustered by senate

1967
01:09:08 --> 01:09:11
<v MR. LEAHY>republicans.

1968
01:09:11 --> 01:09:13
<v MR. LEAHY>Just a few years ago, judge

1969
01:09:13 --> 01:09:15
<v MR. LEAHY>denny chin, an outstanding

1970
01:09:15 --> 01:09:17
<v MR. LEAHY>nominee with 16 years judicial

1971
01:09:17 --> 01:09:18
<v MR. LEAHY>experience, was delayed for

1972
01:09:18 --> 01:09:20
<v MR. LEAHY>being -- from being elevated to

1973
01:09:20 --> 01:09:27
<v MR. LEAHY>the second circuit for four

1974
01:09:27 --> 01:09:27
<v MR. LEAHY>months until we forced a vote.

1975
01:09:27 --> 01:09:29
<v MR. LEAHY>Incidentally, you would think

1976
01:09:29 --> 01:09:32
<v MR. LEAHY>being delayed all that time that

1977
01:09:32 --> 01:09:33
<v MR. LEAHY>there would be a lot of

1978
01:09:33 --> 01:09:34
<v MR. LEAHY>opposition.

1979
01:09:34 --> 01:09:45
<v MR. LEAHY>I would note that the vote on

1980
01:09:45 --> 01:09:47
<v MR. LEAHY>him was 98-0.

1981
01:09:47 --> 01:09:48
<v MR. LEAHY>just like the vote on judge jack

1982
01:09:48 --> 01:09:51
<v MR. LEAHY>Mcconnell, another one.

1983
01:09:51 --> 01:09:53
<v MR. LEAHY>You know, Mcconnell we turned

1984
01:09:53 --> 01:09:54
<v MR. LEAHY>away on a precipice.

1985
01:09:54 --> 01:09:56
<v MR. LEAHY>It's wrong now for us to

1986
01:09:56 --> 01:09:57
<v MR. LEAHY>approach that precipice again.

1987
01:09:57 --> 01:09:58
<v MR. LEAHY>Filibustering this nomination

1988
01:09:58 --> 01:10:00
<v MR. LEAHY>will set a new standard for

1989
01:10:00 --> 01:10:02
<v MR. LEAHY>obstruction of judicial

1990
01:10:02 --> 01:10:03
<v MR. LEAHY>nominations.

1991
01:10:03 --> 01:10:04
<v MR. LEAHY>We need to be working for the

1992
01:10:04 --> 01:10:05
<v MR. LEAHY>american people and putting

1993
01:10:05 --> 01:10:08
<v MR. LEAHY>their needs first.

1994
01:10:08 --> 01:10:11
<v MR. LEAHY>so, Mr. President, I urge them

1995
01:10:11 --> 01:10:13
<v MR. LEAHY>to stop this five-month delay.

1996
01:10:13 --> 01:10:16
<v MR. LEAHY>I would ask consent to put my

1997
01:10:16 --> 01:10:17
<v MR. LEAHY>full statement in the record.

1998
01:10:17 --> 01:10:18
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

1999
01:10:18 --> 01:10:19
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection, so ordered.

2000
01:10:19 --> 01:10:21
<v MR. LEAHY>and, Mr. President, I

2001
01:10:21 --> 01:10:23
<v MR. LEAHY>see the deputy republican leader

2002
01:10:23 --> 01:10:25
<v MR. LEAHY>on the floor.

2003
01:10:25 --> 01:10:27
<v MR. LEAHY>I simply say I have -- if you

2004
01:10:27 --> 01:10:30
<v MR. LEAHY>would just hold for a moment.

2005
01:10:30 --> 01:10:31
<v MR. LEAHY>I have ten unanimous consent

2006
01:10:31 --> 01:10:32
<v MR. LEAHY>requests for committees to meet

2007
01:10:32 --> 01:10:33
<v MR. LEAHY>during today's session of the

2008
01:10:33 --> 01:10:33
<v MR. LEAHY>senate.

2009
01:10:33 --> 01:10:35
<v MR. LEAHY>They have the approval of the

2010
01:10:35 --> 01:10:36
<v MR. LEAHY>majority and minority leaders.

2011
01:10:36 --> 01:10:37
<v MR. LEAHY>I ask unanimous consent these

2012
01:10:37 --> 01:10:38
<v MR. LEAHY>requests be agreed to and the

2013
01:10:38 --> 01:10:39
<v MR. LEAHY>requests be printed in the

2014
01:10:39 --> 01:10:39
<v MR. LEAHY>record.

2015
01:10:39 --> 01:10:41
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

2016
01:10:41 --> 01:10:42
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection, so ordered.

2017
01:10:42 --> 01:10:43
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>Morning business is closed.

01:10:43 --> 01:10:45
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>Under the previous order, the

<v MR. KYL>The senator from tennessee.

2047
01:11:46 --> 01:11:47
<v MR. KYL>I said texas.

<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection, so ordered.

2051
01:11:51 --> 01:11:52
<v MR. KYL>Mr. President, I need

2052
01:11:52 --> 01:11:54
<v MR. KYL>to speak for a few minutes this

2053
01:11:54 --> 01:11:56
<v MR. KYL>morning about two important news

2054
01:11:56 --> 01:11:57
<v MR. KYL>events of this week -- the

2055
01:11:57 --> 01:11:58
<v MR. KYL>budget that was submitted by the

2056
01:11:58 --> 01:11:59
<v MR. KYL>President And the news reports

2057
01:11:59 --> 01:12:01
<v MR. KYL>that the President Is

2058
01:12:01 --> 01:12:03
<v MR. KYL>considering reducing our nuclear

2059
01:12:03 --> 01:12:04
<v MR. KYL>arsenal to dramatically lower

2060
01:12:04 --> 01:12:07
<v MR. KYL>levels than they are today.

2061
01:12:07 --> 01:12:08
<v MR. KYL>So let me speak to both of those

2062
01:12:08 --> 01:12:09
<v MR. KYL>subjects briefly this morning,

2063
01:12:09 --> 01:12:11
<v MR. KYL>and then I will have more to say

2064
01:12:11 --> 01:12:11
<v MR. KYL>about them as time goes on here.

2065
01:12:11 --> 01:12:13
<v MR. KYL>In the President's budget, there

2066
01:12:13 --> 01:12:16
<v MR. KYL>is a specific part for the

2067
01:12:16 --> 01:12:18
<v MR. KYL>department of energy that funds

2068
01:12:18 --> 01:12:19
<v MR. KYL>the nuclear weapon program, and

2069
01:12:19 --> 01:12:20
<v MR. KYL>despite promises of the

2070
01:12:20 --> 01:12:25
<v MR. KYL>President That he would follow

2071
01:12:25 --> 01:12:26
<v MR. KYL>what's called the 1251 study and

2072
01:12:26 --> 01:12:28
<v MR. KYL>over the course of his

2073
01:12:28 --> 01:12:31
<v MR. KYL>presidency request in the budget

2074
01:12:31 --> 01:12:36
<v MR. KYL>that sums up money for the

2075
01:12:36 --> 01:12:36
<v MR. KYL>department that's called the

2076
01:12:36 --> 01:12:38
<v MR. KYL>N.N.S.A., part of the department

2077
01:12:38 --> 01:12:40
<v MR. KYL>of energy, he reduced that this

2078
01:12:40 --> 01:12:42
<v MR. KYL>year by $372 million less than

2079
01:12:42 --> 01:12:43
<v MR. KYL>the target, and the net result

2080
01:12:43 --> 01:12:45
<v MR. KYL>of that over five years is going

2081
01:12:45 --> 01:12:46
<v MR. KYL>to be $4.3 billion.

2082
01:12:46 --> 01:12:47
<v MR. KYL>I know my colleague from

2083
01:12:47 --> 01:12:48
<v MR. KYL>tennessee is very interested in

2084
01:12:48 --> 01:12:51
<v MR. KYL>this.

2085
01:12:51 --> 01:12:53
<v MR. KYL>before the start treaty was

2086
01:12:53 --> 01:12:54
<v MR. KYL>debated, there was a big debate

2087
01:12:54 --> 01:12:57
<v MR. KYL>about whether or not the funding

2088
01:12:57 --> 01:12:59
<v MR. KYL>for the nnsa and the nuclear

2089
01:12:59 --> 01:13:00
<v MR. KYL>modernization program was

2090
01:13:00 --> 01:13:02
<v MR. KYL>adequate.

2091
01:13:02 --> 01:13:06
<v MR. KYL>On the veterans day recess

2092
01:13:06 --> 01:13:08
<v MR. KYL>before we began the debate on

2093
01:13:08 --> 01:13:11
<v MR. KYL>start, general shelton, former

2094
01:13:11 --> 01:13:14
<v MR. KYL>head of stratcom and Dr. Miller,

2095
01:13:14 --> 01:13:17
<v MR. KYL>assistant secretary of defense,

2096
01:13:17 --> 01:13:20
<v MR. KYL>flew to phoenix and said to me

2097
01:13:20 --> 01:13:22
<v MR. KYL>you were right, we were wrong,

2098
01:13:22 --> 01:13:23
<v MR. KYL>we have underfunded this by over

2099
01:13:23 --> 01:13:27
<v MR. KYL>$4 billion and we're going to

2100
01:13:27 --> 01:13:27
<v MR. KYL>add that to our five-year budget

2101
01:13:27 --> 01:13:28
<v MR. KYL>profile.

2102
01:13:28 --> 01:13:30
<v MR. KYL>This was the argument that we

2103
01:13:30 --> 01:13:32
<v MR. KYL>have been making all along.

2104
01:13:32 --> 01:13:33
<v MR. KYL>You have underfunded the nuclear

2105
01:13:33 --> 01:13:36
<v MR. KYL>modernization program, you need

2106
01:13:36 --> 01:13:36
<v MR. KYL>to add between $4 billion and

2107
01:13:36 --> 01:13:37
<v MR. KYL>$5 billion to it.

2108
01:13:37 --> 01:13:39
<v MR. KYL>They agreed.

2109
01:13:39 --> 01:13:41
<v MR. KYL>That went into what was called

2110
01:13:41 --> 01:13:41
<v MR. KYL>the revised 1251 report.

2111
01:13:41 --> 01:13:43
<v MR. KYL>As a result of the budget

2112
01:13:43 --> 01:13:44
<v MR. KYL>request this year, we're right

2113
01:13:44 --> 01:13:47
<v MR. KYL>back to where we started from

2114
01:13:47 --> 01:13:49
<v MR. KYL>before the revisions,

2115
01:13:49 --> 01:13:50
<v MR. KYL>4.3 billion alone, and that's

2116
01:13:50 --> 01:13:51
<v MR. KYL>where we were when the

2117
01:13:51 --> 01:13:53
<v MR. KYL>administration came forward and

2118
01:13:53 --> 01:13:55
<v MR. KYL>said you're right, we were

2119
01:13:55 --> 01:13:56
<v MR. KYL>wrong, our previous figure

2120
01:13:56 --> 01:13:58
<v MR. KYL>wasn't enough.

2121
01:13:58 --> 01:14:00
<v MR. KYL>So we have got a problem and

2122
01:14:00 --> 01:14:01
<v MR. KYL>it's going to cause some real

2123
01:14:01 --> 01:14:02
<v MR. KYL>disruptions.

2124
01:14:02 --> 01:14:04
<v MR. KYL>One of the things we have to do

2125
01:14:04 --> 01:14:06
<v MR. KYL>is extend the life of one of our

2126
01:14:06 --> 01:14:09
<v MR. KYL>old weapons called the b-61.

2127
01:14:09 --> 01:14:09
<v MR. KYL>This is a two-year delay now on

2128
01:14:09 --> 01:14:12
<v MR. KYL>that.

2129
01:14:12 --> 01:14:14
<v MR. KYL>A two-year delay on another

2130
01:14:14 --> 01:14:16
<v MR. KYL>warhead called the w-76.

2131
01:14:16 --> 01:14:18
<v MR. KYL>At least a five-year delay in

2132
01:14:18 --> 01:14:20
<v MR. KYL>the production of the plutonium

2133
01:14:20 --> 01:14:23
<v MR. KYL>processing facility at los

2134
01:14:23 --> 01:14:24
<v MR. KYL>alamos laboratory called the

2135
01:14:24 --> 01:14:27
<v MR. KYL>cmrr facility.

2136
01:14:27 --> 01:14:29
<v MR. KYL>Now, why is that important?

2137
01:14:29 --> 01:14:30
<v MR. KYL>We knew prior to the commitments

2138
01:14:30 --> 01:14:33
<v MR. KYL>the President Made before the

2139
01:14:33 --> 01:14:35
<v MR. KYL>start treaty was debated that

2140
01:14:35 --> 01:14:37
<v MR. KYL>the cmrr was critical.

2141
01:14:37 --> 01:14:38
<v MR. KYL>We don't have a production

2142
01:14:38 --> 01:14:40
<v MR. KYL>capacity.

2143
01:14:40 --> 01:14:43
<v MR. KYL>Unlike russia and china, for

2144
01:14:43 --> 01:14:43
<v MR. KYL>example, we can't produce new

2145
01:14:43 --> 01:14:45
<v MR. KYL>nuclear weapons.

2146
01:14:45 --> 01:14:46
<v MR. KYL>We have to go back and revise

2147
01:14:46 --> 01:14:48
<v MR. KYL>the ones we have.

2148
01:14:48 --> 01:14:50
<v MR. KYL>And one of the facilities that

2149
01:14:50 --> 01:14:52
<v MR. KYL>would enable us to do that is

2150
01:14:52 --> 01:14:54
<v MR. KYL>this cmrr facility.

2151
01:14:54 --> 01:14:56
<v MR. KYL>In fact, that's where a great

2152
01:14:56 --> 01:14:58
<v MR. KYL>deal of the work would be done.

2153
01:14:58 --> 01:15:01
<v MR. KYL>And what we were told was that

2154
01:15:01 --> 01:15:03
<v MR. KYL>the President Was fully

2155
01:15:03 --> 01:15:05
<v MR. KYL>committed to constructing this

2156
01:15:05 --> 01:15:07
<v MR. KYL>facility on the timetable set

2157
01:15:07 --> 01:15:11
<v MR. KYL>out on the 1251 report.

2158
01:15:11 --> 01:15:12
<v MR. KYL>some of us were a little

2159
01:15:12 --> 01:15:12
<v MR. KYL>diabetesious.

2160
01:15:12 --> 01:15:14
<v MR. KYL>The President's representative

2161
01:15:14 --> 01:15:17
<v MR. KYL>said we'll put it to you in

2162
01:15:17 --> 01:15:19
<v MR. KYL>writing, and so he did, and what

2163
01:15:19 --> 01:15:21
<v MR. KYL>he said in his message on the

2164
01:15:21 --> 01:15:25
<v MR. KYL>new start treaty to the senate

2165
01:15:25 --> 01:15:27
<v MR. KYL>with regard to this facility --

2166
01:15:27 --> 01:15:29
<v MR. KYL>and I will quote it, the letter

2167
01:15:29 --> 01:15:32
<v MR. KYL>related to his intent to

2168
01:15:32 --> 01:15:35
<v MR. KYL>modernize and replace the triad,

2169
01:15:35 --> 01:15:36
<v MR. KYL>and he said -- quote -- &quot;to

2170
01:15:36 --> 01:15:38
<v MR. KYL>accelerate to the extent

2171
01:15:38 --> 01:15:43
<v MR. KYL>possible the design engineering

2172
01:15:43 --> 01:15:46
<v MR. KYL>phase of the chemistry and met met a

2173
01:15:46 --> 01:15:49
<v MR. KYL>lurchy replacement or cmrr

2174
01:15:49 --> 01:15:51
<v MR. KYL>building and the facility for

2175
01:15:51 --> 01:15:53
<v MR. KYL>uranium processing in oak ridge,

2176
01:15:53 --> 01:15:54
<v MR. KYL>tennessee, and to request full

2177
01:15:54 --> 01:15:56
<v MR. KYL>funding including on a multiyear

2178
01:15:56 --> 01:15:59
<v MR. KYL>basis as appropriate for the

2179
01:15:59 --> 01:16:01
<v MR. KYL>cmrr building and the U.P.F.,

2180
01:16:01 --> 01:16:06
<v MR. KYL>upon completion of design and

2181
01:16:06 --> 01:16:08
<v MR. KYL>engineering sphaiz.&quot;

2182
01:16:08 --> 01:16:09
<v MR. KYL>we were concerned they wouldn't

2183
01:16:09 --> 01:16:09
<v MR. KYL>accelerate the construction of

2184
01:16:09 --> 01:16:11
<v MR. KYL>these facilities.

2185
01:16:11 --> 01:16:12
<v MR. KYL>He said we.

2186
01:16:12 --> 01:16:15
<v MR. KYL>he would accelerate it to the

2187
01:16:15 --> 01:16:17
<v MR. KYL>extent possible and request full

2188
01:16:17 --> 01:16:19
<v MR. KYL>funding on a multi-year basis.

2189
01:16:19 --> 01:16:20
<v MR. KYL>The budget he submitted this

2190
01:16:20 --> 01:16:22
<v MR. KYL>year breaks that commitment to

2191
01:16:22 --> 01:16:24
<v MR. KYL>the united states senate and

2192
01:16:24 --> 01:16:25
<v MR. KYL>those senators who voted for the

2193
01:16:25 --> 01:16:26
<v MR. KYL>treaty based upon these

2194
01:16:26 --> 01:16:28
<v MR. KYL>commitments are obviously going

2195
01:16:28 --> 01:16:30
<v MR. KYL>to be re-evaluating their

2196
01:16:30 --> 01:16:31
<v MR. KYL>support for the treaty.

2197
01:16:31 --> 01:16:32
<v MR. KYL>And there are things that can be

2198
01:16:32 --> 01:16:34
<v MR. KYL>done by the congress, including

2199
01:16:34 --> 01:16:37
<v MR. KYL>our power of the purse, to deal

2200
01:16:37 --> 01:16:39
<v MR. KYL>with the issue, which I hope to

2201
01:16:39 --> 01:16:40
<v MR. KYL>have time to speak to in a

2202
01:16:40 --> 01:16:41
<v MR. KYL>moment.

2203
01:16:41 --> 01:16:43
<v MR. KYL>Former secretary gates reflected

2204
01:16:43 --> 01:16:45
<v MR. KYL>the senate's reliance on these

2205
01:16:45 --> 01:16:48
<v MR. KYL>commitments when he said --

2206
01:16:48 --> 01:16:49
<v MR. KYL>this is a quotation -- &quot;this

2207
01:16:49 --> 01:16:50
<v MR. KYL>modernization program was

2208
01:16:50 --> 01:16:51
<v MR. KYL>carefully worked out between

2209
01:16:51 --> 01:16:52
<v MR. KYL>ourselves and the department of

2210
01:16:52 --> 01:16:54
<v MR. KYL>energy and frankly, where we

2211
01:16:54 --> 01:16:55
<v MR. KYL>came out on that played a fairly

2212
01:16:55 --> 01:16:59
<v MR. KYL>significant role in the willness

2213
01:16:59 --> 01:17:00
<v MR. KYL>of the senate to ratify the new

2214
01:17:00 --> 01:17:02
<v MR. KYL>start agreement.&quot;

2215
01:17:02 --> 01:17:03
<v MR. KYL>so for those who relied on the

2216
01:17:03 --> 01:17:05
<v MR. KYL>administration's commitment,

2217
01:17:05 --> 01:17:06
<v MR. KYL>they've been broken, we're

2218
01:17:06 --> 01:17:08
<v MR. KYL>right back to where we started

2219
01:17:08 --> 01:17:09
<v MR. KYL>from before the treaty was taken

2220
01:17:09 --> 01:17:10
<v MR. KYL>up.

2221
01:17:10 --> 01:17:12
<v MR. KYL>And if you want to know

2222
01:17:12 --> 01:17:15
<v MR. KYL>specifically what the problems

2223
01:17:15 --> 01:17:16
<v MR. KYL>are, Dr. Charles Mcmillan,

2224
01:17:16 --> 01:17:19
<v MR. KYL>the los alamos director, said,

2225
01:17:19 --> 01:17:20
<v MR. KYL>I'm quoting, &quot;without cmrr

2226
01:17:20 --> 01:17:23
<v MR. KYL>there is no identified path to

2227
01:17:23 --> 01:17:26
<v MR. KYL>meet the nation's requirement of

2228
01:17:26 --> 01:17:30
<v MR. KYL>50 to 80 pits per year, the

2229
01:17:30 --> 01:17:32
<v MR. KYL>fiscal reductions compounds a

2230
01:17:32 --> 01:17:33
<v MR. KYL>set of 2012 challenges and

2231
01:17:33 --> 01:17:35
<v MR. KYL>raises questions whether we can

2232
01:17:35 --> 01:17:37
<v MR. KYL>meet the pace of the

2233
01:17:37 --> 01:17:40
<v MR. KYL>modernization path outlined in

2234
01:17:40 --> 01:17:41
<v MR. KYL>the 2010 nuclear posture

2235
01:17:41 --> 01:17:42
<v MR. KYL>review.&quot;

2236
01:17:42 --> 01:17:43
<v MR. KYL>Mr. President, we've got a

2237
01:17:43 --> 01:17:43
<v MR. KYL>problem.

2238
01:17:43 --> 01:17:45
<v MR. KYL>And unless the President Is

2239
01:17:45 --> 01:17:46
<v MR. KYL>willing to work with members of

2240
01:17:46 --> 01:17:47
<v MR. KYL>congress and unless members of

2241
01:17:47 --> 01:17:49
<v MR. KYL>congress are willing to

2242
01:17:49 --> 01:17:50
<v MR. KYL>recognize that the senate acted

2243
01:17:50 --> 01:17:51
<v MR. KYL>based upon commitments the

2244
01:17:51 --> 01:17:52
<v MR. KYL>administration made and we have

2245
01:17:52 --> 01:17:54
<v MR. KYL>to keep our end of the bargain

2246
01:17:54 --> 01:17:56
<v MR. KYL>as well, we're going to find a

2247
01:17:56 --> 01:17:58
<v MR. KYL>huge problem with our

2248
01:17:58 --> 01:18:01
<v MR. KYL>modernization program with our

2249
01:18:01 --> 01:18:03
<v MR. KYL>nuclear weapon program, and all

2250
01:18:03 --> 01:18:04
<v MR. KYL>of that portends with respect to

2251
01:18:04 --> 01:18:06
<v MR. KYL>our current capability.

2252
01:18:06 --> 01:18:09
<v MR. KYL>Now let me turn to the other

2253
01:18:09 --> 01:18:10
<v MR. KYL>news of the week, the

2254
01:18:10 --> 01:18:12
<v MR. KYL>President's people confirmed

2255
01:18:12 --> 01:18:14
<v MR. KYL>yes, they are in fact studying

2256
01:18:14 --> 01:18:15
<v MR. KYL>whether or not we can reduce our

2257
01:18:15 --> 01:18:18
<v MR. KYL>nuclear warhead.

2258
01:18:18 --> 01:18:21
<v MR. KYL>remember we were at 1,500 for

2259
01:18:21 --> 01:18:24
<v MR. KYL>start, and an 80% reduction

2260
01:18:24 --> 01:18:25
<v MR. KYL>could take us down to 300.

2261
01:18:25 --> 01:18:26
<v MR. KYL>Now, that is almost unthinkable

2262
01:18:26 --> 01:18:27
<v MR. KYL>especially in today

2263
01:18:27 --> 01:18:30
<v MR. KYL>environment where you have

2264
01:18:30 --> 01:18:32
<v MR. KYL>russia and china with new

2265
01:18:32 --> 01:18:33
<v MR. KYL>production capacities, they are

2266
01:18:33 --> 01:18:34
<v MR. KYL>developing new nuclear weapons

2267
01:18:34 --> 01:18:37
<v MR. KYL>and producing them.

2268
01:18:37 --> 01:18:39
<v MR. KYL>we are not designing or

2269
01:18:39 --> 01:18:41
<v MR. KYL>developing any new nuclear weebs

2270
01:18:41 --> 01:18:42
<v MR. KYL>weapons, we have no plans to do

2271
01:18:42 --> 01:18:44
<v MR. KYL>so and we have no production

2272
01:18:44 --> 01:18:45
<v MR. KYL>capacity to make them even if we

2273
01:18:45 --> 01:18:46
<v MR. KYL>did.

2274
01:18:46 --> 01:18:48
<v MR. KYL>And the production -- the

2275
01:18:48 --> 01:18:50
<v MR. KYL>capacity to refurbish the old

2276
01:18:50 --> 01:18:51
<v MR. KYL>ones is now going to be delayed

2277
01:18:51 --> 01:18:53
<v MR. KYL>another five years.

2278
01:18:53 --> 01:18:56
<v MR. KYL>So why would we be thinking

2279
01:18:56 --> 01:18:57
<v MR. KYL>about reducing our warheads even

2280
01:18:57 --> 01:18:58
<v MR. KYL>further under these

2281
01:18:58 --> 01:18:59
<v MR. KYL>circumstances?

2282
01:18:59 --> 01:19:02
<v MR. KYL>well, some people say with a

2283
01:19:02 --> 01:19:04
<v MR. KYL>really robust nuclear -- excuse

2284
01:19:04 --> 01:19:07
<v MR. KYL>me missile defense program and

2285
01:19:07 --> 01:19:07
<v MR. KYL>by upgrading our conventional

2286
01:19:07 --> 01:19:08
<v MR. KYL>capabilities we might think

2287
01:19:08 --> 01:19:10
<v MR. KYL>about this.

2288
01:19:10 --> 01:19:12
<v MR. KYL>The problem with those two

2289
01:19:12 --> 01:19:13
<v MR. KYL>asumses is this budget cut both

2290
01:19:13 --> 01:19:15
<v MR. KYL>of them dramatically as well.

2291
01:19:15 --> 01:19:16
<v MR. KYL>We're not enhancing conventional

2292
01:19:16 --> 01:19:17
<v MR. KYL>capabilities.

2293
01:19:17 --> 01:19:19
<v MR. KYL>We're drawing them down.

2294
01:19:19 --> 01:19:20
<v MR. KYL>which, by the way, is what has

2295
01:19:20 --> 01:19:22
<v MR. KYL>caused the russians to rely much

2296
01:19:22 --> 01:19:23
<v MR. KYL>more heavily on their nuclear

2297
01:19:23 --> 01:19:25
<v MR. KYL>program.

2298
01:19:25 --> 01:19:27
<v MR. KYL>What about the people who rely

2299
01:19:27 --> 01:19:29
<v MR. KYL>on our nuclear deterrence, the

2300
01:19:29 --> 01:19:30
<v MR. KYL>32 countries that rely on our

2301
01:19:30 --> 01:19:32
<v MR. KYL>nuclear umbrella?

2302
01:19:32 --> 01:19:33
<v MR. KYL>If they see this my guess

2303
01:19:33 --> 01:19:35
<v MR. KYL>they're going to look at what

2304
01:19:35 --> 01:19:35
<v MR. KYL>they might do to develop their

2305
01:19:35 --> 01:19:38
<v MR. KYL>own weapons.

2306
01:19:38 --> 01:19:40
<v MR. KYL>So much for nonproliferation.

2307
01:19:40 --> 01:19:44
<v MR. KYL>what about the idea that

2308
01:19:44 --> 01:19:46
<v MR. KYL>countries that now have close to

2309
01:19:46 --> 01:19:47
<v MR. KYL>300 weapons could become peers

2310
01:19:47 --> 01:19:49
<v MR. KYL>of the united states?

2311
01:19:49 --> 01:19:50
<v MR. KYL>How is that for strategy, to

2312
01:19:50 --> 01:19:53
<v MR. KYL>have pakistan, which will have

2313
01:19:53 --> 01:19:55
<v MR. KYL>soon more weapons than britain

2314
01:19:55 --> 01:19:56
<v MR. KYL>does, to have as many weapons,

2315
01:19:56 --> 01:19:57
<v MR. KYL>nuclear weapons as the united

2316
01:19:57 --> 01:19:58
<v MR. KYL>states?

2317
01:19:58 --> 01:20:00
<v MR. KYL>That's not exactly the most

2318
01:20:00 --> 01:20:02
<v MR. KYL>stable place in the world today.

2319
01:20:02 --> 01:20:03
<v MR. KYL>Iran is developing its

2320
01:20:03 --> 01:20:05
<v MR. KYL>capability, north korea already

2321
01:20:05 --> 01:20:07
<v MR. KYL>has it, the chinese are already

2322
01:20:07 --> 01:20:08
<v MR. KYL>at roughly this level and

2323
01:20:08 --> 01:20:10
<v MR. KYL>improving their capability and

2324
01:20:10 --> 01:20:12
<v MR. KYL>of course russia is much above

2325
01:20:12 --> 01:20:14
<v MR. KYL>it, and talking about actually

2326
01:20:14 --> 01:20:16
<v MR. KYL>building more nuclear weapons,

2327
01:20:16 --> 01:20:17
<v MR. KYL>not fewer.

2328
01:20:17 --> 01:20:20
<v MR. KYL>You know, just to mention one

2329
01:20:20 --> 01:20:24
<v MR. KYL>other point here, let me

2330
01:20:24 --> 01:20:25
<v MR. KYL>close, the defense minister in

2331
01:20:25 --> 01:20:27
<v MR. KYL>russia recently said on

2332
01:20:27 --> 01:20:27
<v MR. KYL>February 6, I do not rule out

2333
01:20:28 --> 01:20:29
<v MR. KYL>that under certain circumstances

2334
01:20:29 --> 01:20:30
<v MR. KYL>we will have to boost, not

2335
01:20:30 --> 01:20:32
<v MR. KYL>cut, our nuclear arsenal.

2336
01:20:32 --> 01:20:33
<v MR. KYL>Now we're talking about reducing

2337
01:20:33 --> 01:20:36
<v MR. KYL>ours.

2338
01:20:36 --> 01:20:38
<v MR. KYL>How are we going to convince our

2339
01:20:38 --> 01:20:39
<v MR. KYL>russians to reduce there's?

2340
01:20:39 --> 01:20:40
<v MR. KYL>I assume it's going to be an

2341
01:20:40 --> 01:20:41
<v MR. KYL>additional treaty with the

2342
01:20:41 --> 01:20:42
<v MR. KYL>russians.

2343
01:20:42 --> 01:20:44
<v MR. KYL>Not likely to occur.

2344
01:20:44 --> 01:20:45
<v MR. KYL>But to me one of the most

2345
01:20:45 --> 01:20:50
<v MR. KYL>bothersome things here is one of

2346
01:20:50 --> 01:20:52
<v MR. KYL>the arguments that nuclear

2347
01:20:52 --> 01:20:54
<v MR. KYL>opponents have had we never want

2348
01:20:54 --> 01:20:56
<v MR. KYL>to get to the point where our

2349
01:20:56 --> 01:20:58
<v MR. KYL>doctrine of stead of holding

2350
01:20:58 --> 01:21:01
<v MR. KYL>hostage the military capability

2351
01:21:01 --> 01:21:04
<v MR. KYL>of any would-be adversary would

2352
01:21:04 --> 01:21:06
<v MR. KYL>be to hold civilians hostage,

2353
01:21:06 --> 01:21:07
<v MR. KYL>innocent civilians and that's

2354
01:21:07 --> 01:21:10
<v MR. KYL>precisely what happens when

2355
01:21:10 --> 01:21:11
<v MR. KYL>instead of having enough targets

2356
01:21:11 --> 01:21:14
<v MR. KYL>to cover all the military

2357
01:21:14 --> 01:21:17
<v MR. KYL>targets of an adversary, you

2358
01:21:17 --> 01:21:18
<v MR. KYL>only have enough weapons to hold

2359
01:21:18 --> 01:21:20
<v MR. KYL>hostage the cities of your

2360
01:21:20 --> 01:21:21
<v MR. KYL>adversary and thus the civilian

2361
01:21:21 --> 01:21:23
<v MR. KYL>population of those countries.

2362
01:21:23 --> 01:21:25
<v MR. KYL>that is not a moral deterrent,

2363
01:21:25 --> 01:21:27
<v MR. KYL>and as a result I think we have

2364
01:21:27 --> 01:21:29
<v MR. KYL>to think very carefully about

2365
01:21:29 --> 01:21:31
<v MR. KYL>this prospect of reducing our

2366
01:21:31 --> 01:21:32
<v MR. KYL>nuclear weaponry.

2367
01:21:32 --> 01:21:34
<v MR. KYL>We obviously have to do a lot

2368
01:21:34 --> 01:21:35
<v MR. KYL>more work on this issue in the

2369
01:21:35 --> 01:21:38
<v MR. KYL>congress.

2370
01:21:38 --> 01:21:40
<v MR. KYL>As I said, we have some means

2371
01:21:40 --> 01:21:41
<v MR. KYL>of expressing our views to the

2372
01:21:41 --> 01:21:43
<v MR. KYL>administration.

2373
01:21:43 --> 01:21:44
<v MR. KYL>i think it needs to think very

2374
01:21:44 --> 01:21:46
<v MR. KYL>darefully about this.

2375
01:21:46 --> 01:21:49
<v MR. KYL>To the extent it thinks it's

2376
01:21:49 --> 01:21:51
<v MR. KYL>going to help or solve,, or

2377
01:21:51 --> 01:21:52
<v MR. KYL>help with our financial crisis,

2378
01:21:52 --> 01:21:54
<v MR. KYL>reducing the number of warhead

2379
01:21:54 --> 01:21:56
<v MR. KYL>doesn't reduce our expense.

2380
01:21:56 --> 01:21:57
<v MR. KYL>It's a little like the bracc

2381
01:21:57 --> 01:21:58
<v MR. KYL>commission.

2382
01:21:58 --> 01:22:00
<v MR. KYL>That cannot be cited as a reason

2383
01:22:00 --> 01:22:02
<v MR. KYL>to do this.

2384
01:22:02 --> 01:22:03
<v MR. KYL>Nor is there a prospect we can

2385
01:22:03 --> 01:22:05
<v MR. KYL>serve as a moral example to

2386
01:22:05 --> 01:22:06
<v MR. KYL>other countries by reducing our

2387
01:22:06 --> 01:22:08
<v MR. KYL>warheads to that level.

2388
01:22:08 --> 01:22:10
<v MR. KYL>The start treaty was supposed to

2389
01:22:10 --> 01:22:11
<v MR. KYL>be a new reset, showing the

2390
01:22:12 --> 01:22:14
<v MR. KYL>world through our moral example

2391
01:22:14 --> 01:22:14
<v MR. KYL>the benefits of reducing

2392
01:22:14 --> 01:22:16
<v MR. KYL>warheads.

2393
01:22:16 --> 01:22:18
<v MR. KYL>And not a country in the world

2394
01:22:18 --> 01:22:20
<v MR. KYL>has reduced warheads since the

2395
01:22:20 --> 01:22:21
<v MR. KYL>signing of the new start treaty.

2396
01:22:21 --> 01:22:23
<v MR. KYL>Except the united states.

2397
01:22:23 --> 01:22:25
<v MR. KYL>russia hasn't, china hasn't,

2398
01:22:25 --> 01:22:26
<v MR. KYL>pakistan hasn't, our allies

2399
01:22:26 --> 01:22:28
<v MR. KYL>have not.

2400
01:22:28 --> 01:22:30
<v MR. KYL>And iran and north korea dawning

2401
01:22:30 --> 01:22:30
<v MR. KYL>talk about expanding their

2402
01:22:30 --> 01:22:34
<v MR. KYL>programs.

2403
01:22:34 --> 01:22:35
<v MR. KYL>So this is based on a very shaky

2404
01:22:35 --> 01:22:37
<v MR. KYL>proposition of benefits which

2405
01:22:37 --> 01:22:40
<v MR. KYL>are very unlikely to occur and

2406
01:22:40 --> 01:22:43
<v MR. KYL>it is fraught with dangers that

2407
01:22:43 --> 01:22:44
<v MR. KYL>we must debate in this country

2408
01:22:44 --> 01:22:46
<v MR. KYL>without -- before the President

2409
01:22:46 --> 01:22:48
<v MR. KYL>Simply unilaterally decides to

2410
01:22:48 --> 01:22:49
<v MR. KYL>make such a drastic change in

2411
01:22:49 --> 01:22:51
<v MR. KYL>american policy.

2412
01:22:51 --> 01:22:52
<v MR. KYL>We'll have more time to discuss

2413
01:22:52 --> 01:22:53
<v MR. KYL>this in the future but,

2414
01:22:53 --> 01:22:54
<v MR. KYL>Mr. President, given the fact

2415
01:22:54 --> 01:22:56
<v MR. KYL>these two events were really

2416
01:22:56 --> 01:22:57
<v MR. KYL>kicked off this week, the

2417
01:22:57 --> 01:22:58
<v MR. KYL>President's budget and this

2418
01:22:58 --> 01:22:59
<v MR. KYL>latest announcement, I thought

2419
01:22:59 --> 01:23:00
<v MR. KYL>we should at least have a

2420
01:23:00 --> 01:23:02
<v MR. KYL>preliminary discussion of it on

2421
01:23:02 --> 01:23:04
<v MR. KYL>the floor of the senate today.

2422
01:23:04 --> 01:23:05
<v MR. KYL>i yield to my colleague from

2423
01:23:05 --> 01:23:06
<v MR. KYL>tennessee.

2424
01:23:06 --> 01:23:07
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Mr. President.

2425
01:23:08 --> 01:23:09
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

2426
01:23:09 --> 01:23:10
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senior senator from tennessee is

2427
01:23:10 --> 01:23:11
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>recognized.

2428
01:23:11 --> 01:23:12
<v MR. ALEXANDER>I'd like to talk

2429
01:23:12 --> 01:23:13
<v MR. ALEXANDER>as if in morning business.

2430
01:23:13 --> 01:23:14
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

2431
01:23:14 --> 01:23:15
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection, so ordered.

2432
01:23:15 --> 01:23:17
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Mr. President,

2433
01:23:17 --> 01:23:18
<v MR. ALEXANDER>I'm here to talk about another

2434
01:23:18 --> 01:23:20
<v MR. ALEXANDER>subject, marketplace fairness

2435
01:23:20 --> 01:23:21
<v MR. ALEXANDER>but before I do, I want to

2436
01:23:21 --> 01:23:22
<v MR. ALEXANDER>acknowledge the importance of

2437
01:23:22 --> 01:23:24
<v MR. ALEXANDER>what the senator from arizona

2438
01:23:24 --> 01:23:27
<v MR. ALEXANDER>has had to say and his

2439
01:23:27 --> 01:23:29
<v MR. ALEXANDER>leadership especially in the

2440
01:23:29 --> 01:23:31
<v MR. ALEXANDER>whole area of our nuclear

2441
01:23:31 --> 01:23:33
<v MR. ALEXANDER>doctrine, but especially in the

2442
01:23:33 --> 01:23:33
<v MR. ALEXANDER>area of nuclear weapons

2443
01:23:33 --> 01:23:37
<v MR. ALEXANDER>modernization.

2444
01:23:37 --> 01:23:41
<v MR. ALEXANDER>I think he's correct to say that

2445
01:23:41 --> 01:23:43
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the discussion about section

2446
01:23:43 --> 01:23:46
<v MR. ALEXANDER>1251 which he described, which

2447
01:23:46 --> 01:23:49
<v MR. ALEXANDER>is the goal for the amount of

2448
01:23:49 --> 01:23:51
<v MR. ALEXANDER>money we need to modernize our

2449
01:23:51 --> 01:23:53
<v MR. ALEXANDER>nuclear weapons that we have in

2450
01:23:53 --> 01:23:56
<v MR. ALEXANDER>this country May not have been

2451
01:23:56 --> 01:23:58
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the reason that the new start

2452
01:23:58 --> 01:24:01
<v MR. ALEXANDER>treaty passed, but I doubt the

2453
01:24:01 --> 01:24:03
<v MR. ALEXANDER>new start treaty would have been

2454
01:24:03 --> 01:24:05
<v MR. ALEXANDER>ratified without it.

2455
01:24:05 --> 01:24:06
<v MR. ALEXANDER>so it is an important part of

2456
01:24:06 --> 01:24:07
<v MR. ALEXANDER>that debate, and it's an

2457
01:24:07 --> 01:24:08
<v MR. ALEXANDER>important part of the debate

2458
01:24:08 --> 01:24:10
<v MR. ALEXANDER>today.

2459
01:24:10 --> 01:24:11
<v MR. ALEXANDER>And I'm one of those senators

2460
01:24:11 --> 01:24:12
<v MR. ALEXANDER>who is right in the middle of

2461
01:24:12 --> 01:24:14
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the discussion.

2462
01:24:14 --> 01:24:15
<v MR. ALEXANDER>I worked with the senator from

2463
01:24:15 --> 01:24:16
<v MR. ALEXANDER>arizona in the last

2464
01:24:16 --> 01:24:18
<v MR. ALEXANDER>appropriations bill, when he

2465
01:24:18 --> 01:24:20
<v MR. ALEXANDER>worked harder than anyone,

2466
01:24:20 --> 01:24:21
<v MR. ALEXANDER>really, to try to get the

2467
01:24:21 --> 01:24:23
<v MR. ALEXANDER>amount of appropriations closer

2468
01:24:23 --> 01:24:27
<v MR. ALEXANDER>to the 1251 number.

2469
01:24:27 --> 01:24:28
<v MR. ALEXANDER>we made some progress, but fell

2470
01:24:28 --> 01:24:29
<v MR. ALEXANDER>short.

2471
01:24:29 --> 01:24:30
<v MR. ALEXANDER>This represents a substantial

2472
01:24:30 --> 01:24:33
<v MR. ALEXANDER>challenge to us.

2473
01:24:33 --> 01:24:34
<v MR. ALEXANDER>So I think he's put his finger

2474
01:24:34 --> 01:24:36
<v MR. ALEXANDER>on a very important problem,

2475
01:24:36 --> 01:24:37
<v MR. ALEXANDER>and when we talk about reducing

2476
01:24:37 --> 01:24:40
<v MR. ALEXANDER>defense spending, this is the

2477
01:24:40 --> 01:24:41
<v MR. ALEXANDER>kind of thing that, or

2478
01:24:41 --> 01:24:42
<v MR. ALEXANDER>sequestering defense spending,

2479
01:24:42 --> 01:24:45
<v MR. ALEXANDER>this is the kind of thing we end

2480
01:24:45 --> 01:24:47
<v MR. ALEXANDER>up having to deal with, because

2481
01:24:47 --> 01:24:50
<v MR. ALEXANDER>even in the last year, both the

2482
01:24:50 --> 01:24:51
<v MR. ALEXANDER>administration and the senate

2483
01:24:51 --> 01:24:52
<v MR. ALEXANDER>appropriations committee moved

2484
01:24:52 --> 01:24:55
<v MR. ALEXANDER>some money from defense over to

2485
01:24:55 --> 01:24:58
<v MR. ALEXANDER>this account to try to increase

2486
01:24:58 --> 01:24:59
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the money for nuclear weapons

2487
01:24:59 --> 01:25:01
<v MR. ALEXANDER>modernization, and still there

2488
01:25:01 --> 01:25:03
<v MR. ALEXANDER>wasn't enough to meet the 1251

2489
01:25:03 --> 01:25:04
<v MR. ALEXANDER>commitment that many of us

2490
01:25:04 --> 01:25:05
<v MR. ALEXANDER>agreed to at the time our new

2491
01:25:05 --> 01:25:07
<v MR. ALEXANDER>start treaty was enacted.

2492
01:25:07 --> 01:25:09
<v MR. ALEXANDER>I thank him for his comments and

2493
01:25:09 --> 01:25:13
<v MR. ALEXANDER>look forward to working with him

2494
01:25:13 --> 01:25:15
<v MR. ALEXANDER>on that important question.

2495
01:25:15 --> 01:25:18
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Mr. President, I'd like to talk

2496
01:25:18 --> 01:25:19
<v MR. ALEXANDER>about marketplace fairness.

2497
01:25:19 --> 01:25:20
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Which ought to be an

2498
01:25:20 --> 01:25:20
<v MR. ALEXANDER>all-american subject here in the

2499
01:25:20 --> 01:25:22
<v MR. ALEXANDER>senate.

2500
01:25:22 --> 01:25:24
<v MR. ALEXANDER>And it's turned out to be one

2501
01:25:24 --> 01:25:26
<v MR. ALEXANDER>that attracts strong bipartisan

2502
01:25:26 --> 01:25:29
<v MR. ALEXANDER>support.

2503
01:25:29 --> 01:25:32
<v MR. ALEXANDER>In November senator enzi of

2504
01:25:32 --> 01:25:35
<v MR. ALEXANDER>wyoming, the democratic whip,

2505
01:25:35 --> 01:25:36
<v MR. ALEXANDER>senator durbin, and I

2506
01:25:36 --> 01:25:39
<v MR. ALEXANDER>introduced along with seven

2507
01:25:39 --> 01:25:39
<v MR. ALEXANDER>other senators, an equal number

2508
01:25:39 --> 01:25:41
<v MR. ALEXANDER>from both sides of the aisle,

2509
01:25:41 --> 01:25:45
<v MR. ALEXANDER>what we call the marketplace

2510
01:25:45 --> 01:25:48
<v MR. ALEXANDER>fairness act to close a 20-year

2511
01:25:48 --> 01:25:49
<v MR. ALEXANDER>loophole that distorts the

2512
01:25:49 --> 01:25:52
<v MR. ALEXANDER>american marketplace by picking

2513
01:25:52 --> 01:25:54
<v MR. ALEXANDER>winners and losers, by

2514
01:25:54 --> 01:25:57
<v MR. ALEXANDER>subsidizing some businesses at

2515
01:25:57 --> 01:25:58
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the expense of other businesses

2516
01:25:58 --> 01:26:01
<v MR. ALEXANDER>and subsidizing some taxpayers

2517
01:26:01 --> 01:26:02
<v MR. ALEXANDER>at the expense of other

2518
01:26:02 --> 01:26:03
<v MR. ALEXANDER>taxpayers.

2519
01:26:03 --> 01:26:07
<v MR. ALEXANDER>My colleagues and I keep talking

2520
01:26:07 --> 01:26:09
<v MR. ALEXANDER>about it because we strongly

2521
01:26:09 --> 01:26:10
<v MR. ALEXANDER>believe, as do many people

2522
01:26:10 --> 01:26:14
<v MR. ALEXANDER>across this country, that now

2523
01:26:14 --> 01:26:16
<v MR. ALEXANDER>is the time for congress to act.

2524
01:26:16 --> 01:26:19
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Many americans don't realize

2525
01:26:19 --> 01:26:21
<v MR. ALEXANDER>that when they buy something on

2526
01:26:21 --> 01:26:22
<v MR. ALEXANDER>line, which we increasingly do

2527
01:26:22 --> 01:26:24
<v MR. ALEXANDER>today, or order something

2528
01:26:24 --> 01:26:27
<v MR. ALEXANDER>through a catalogue, which

2529
01:26:27 --> 01:26:29
<v MR. ALEXANDER>we've done for a long time,

2530
01:26:29 --> 01:26:31
<v MR. ALEXANDER>from a business outside of our

2531
01:26:31 --> 01:26:32
<v MR. ALEXANDER>own state, in the case of the

2532
01:26:32 --> 01:26:36
<v MR. ALEXANDER>catalogue, that we still owe

2533
01:26:36 --> 01:26:37
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the state sales tax.

2534
01:26:37 --> 01:26:39
<v MR. ALEXANDER>So what we're talking about

2535
01:26:39 --> 01:26:41
<v MR. ALEXANDER>doesn't even rise to the dignity

2536
01:26:41 --> 01:26:43
<v MR. ALEXANDER>of a loophole.

2537
01:26:43 --> 01:26:45
<v MR. ALEXANDER>What we're talking about is a

2538
01:26:45 --> 01:26:47
<v MR. ALEXANDER>law that says you owe the state

2539
01:26:47 --> 01:26:48
<v MR. ALEXANDER>sales tax even if you buy it on

2540
01:26:48 --> 01:26:50
<v MR. ALEXANDER>line and even if you buy it from

2541
01:26:50 --> 01:26:52
<v MR. ALEXANDER>a catalogue from out of state,

2542
01:26:52 --> 01:26:56
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the law says today already if

2543
01:26:56 --> 01:26:58
<v MR. ALEXANDER>you buy it, you owe it.

2544
01:26:58 --> 01:27:01
<v MR. ALEXANDER>This is not a problem only for

2545
01:27:01 --> 01:27:02
<v MR. ALEXANDER>big retailers like amazon and

2546
01:27:02 --> 01:27:04
<v MR. ALEXANDER>wal-mart.

2547
01:27:04 --> 01:27:06
<v MR. ALEXANDER>It's a problem -- the problem

2548
01:27:06 --> 01:27:07
<v MR. ALEXANDER>is killing small businesses in

2549
01:27:07 --> 01:27:08
<v MR. ALEXANDER>tennessee and across our

2550
01:27:08 --> 01:27:10
<v MR. ALEXANDER>country.

2551
01:27:10 --> 01:27:12
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Last month governor little

2552
01:27:12 --> 01:27:14
<v MR. ALEXANDER>haslem of tennessee and I spoke

2553
01:27:14 --> 01:27:18
<v MR. ALEXANDER>with small businesses owners

2554
01:27:18 --> 01:27:19
<v MR. ALEXANDER>from oak rinl, chattanooga,

2555
01:27:19 --> 01:27:20
<v MR. ALEXANDER>nashville, and memphis about

2556
01:27:20 --> 01:27:21
<v MR. ALEXANDER>this problem.

2557
01:27:21 --> 01:27:23
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Every single one of those

2558
01:27:23 --> 01:27:24
<v MR. ALEXANDER>business owners shared personal

2559
01:27:24 --> 01:27:27
<v MR. ALEXANDER>stories about how this loophole

2560
01:27:27 --> 01:27:28
<v MR. ALEXANDER>has hurt their business.

2561
01:27:28 --> 01:27:29
<v MR. ALEXANDER>basically, this is what they

2562
01:27:29 --> 01:27:31
<v MR. ALEXANDER>say happens.

2563
01:27:31 --> 01:27:32
<v MR. ALEXANDER>I remember the story of the

2564
01:27:32 --> 01:27:34
<v MR. ALEXANDER>nashville boot company.

2565
01:27:34 --> 01:27:35
<v MR. ALEXANDER>I talked with the owner there.

2566
01:27:35 --> 01:27:38
<v MR. ALEXANDER>A customer comes into the

2567
01:27:38 --> 01:27:39
<v MR. ALEXANDER>store, tries on a boot, gets

2568
01:27:39 --> 01:27:41
<v MR. ALEXANDER>advice from employees about the

2569
01:27:41 --> 01:27:43
<v MR. ALEXANDER>boot, and then goes home to buy

2570
01:27:43 --> 01:27:45
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the product on line in order to

2571
01:27:45 --> 01:27:47
<v MR. ALEXANDER>avoid paying the state sales

2572
01:27:47 --> 01:27:49
<v MR. ALEXANDER>tax, which the customer owes.

2573
01:27:49 --> 01:27:49
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the state law says you owe the

2574
01:27:49 --> 01:27:50
<v MR. ALEXANDER>tax.

2575
01:27:50 --> 01:27:52
<v MR. ALEXANDER>The problem is when you buy

2576
01:27:52 --> 01:27:54
<v MR. ALEXANDER>something at the national boot

2577
01:27:54 --> 01:27:56
<v MR. ALEXANDER>company or any other local

2578
01:27:56 --> 01:27:57
<v MR. ALEXANDER>store, the national boot

2579
01:27:57 --> 01:27:59
<v MR. ALEXANDER>company collects the tax from

2580
01:27:59 --> 01:28:00
<v MR. ALEXANDER>you, adds it to your bill, and

2581
01:28:00 --> 01:28:01
<v MR. ALEXANDER>then sends the money to the

2582
01:28:01 --> 01:28:03
<v MR. ALEXANDER>state.

2583
01:28:03 --> 01:28:04
<v MR. ALEXANDER>That's how it's always worked.

2584
01:28:05 --> 01:28:07
<v MR. ALEXANDER>But if you buy the same boot or

2585
01:28:07 --> 01:28:10
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the same other article on line

2586
01:28:10 --> 01:28:12
<v MR. ALEXANDER>or through a catalogue, that

2587
01:28:12 --> 01:28:13
<v MR. ALEXANDER>business doesn't collect the

2588
01:28:13 --> 01:28:14
<v MR. ALEXANDER>state sales tax, even though

2589
01:28:14 --> 01:28:15
<v MR. ALEXANDER>you owe it.

2590
01:28:15 --> 01:28:17
<v MR. ALEXANDER>So the result is that similar

2591
01:28:17 --> 01:28:20
<v MR. ALEXANDER>businesses selling the same

2592
01:28:20 --> 01:28:20
<v MR. ALEXANDER>thing are being treated entirely

2593
01:28:20 --> 01:28:23
<v MR. ALEXANDER>differently.

2594
01:28:23 --> 01:28:25
<v MR. ALEXANDER>That isn't right, and it isn't

2595
01:28:25 --> 01:28:26
<v MR. ALEXANDER>fair, and most americans who

2596
01:28:26 --> 01:28:27
<v MR. ALEXANDER>have look at the issue agree

2597
01:28:27 --> 01:28:29
<v MR. ALEXANDER>with that.

2598
01:28:29 --> 01:28:32
<v MR. ALEXANDER>so how did this happen?

2599
01:28:32 --> 01:28:34
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Well, in 1992, when most of us

2600
01:28:34 --> 01:28:35
<v MR. ALEXANDER>couldn't possibly have imagined

2601
01:28:35 --> 01:28:38
<v MR. ALEXANDER>how the internet would have

2602
01:28:38 --> 01:28:39
<v MR. ALEXANDER>changed the way we shop for

2603
01:28:39 --> 01:28:42
<v MR. ALEXANDER>things, the supreme court said

2604
01:28:42 --> 01:28:44
<v MR. ALEXANDER>states couldn't require

2605
01:28:44 --> 01:28:46
<v MR. ALEXANDER>out-of-state catalogues or

2606
01:28:46 --> 01:28:48
<v MR. ALEXANDER>online sellers to do the same

2607
01:28:48 --> 01:28:50
<v MR. ALEXANDER>thing states require of stores

2608
01:28:50 --> 01:28:51
<v MR. ALEXANDER>up and down main street.

2609
01:28:51 --> 01:28:53
<v MR. ALEXANDER>What was the reason?

2610
01:28:53 --> 01:28:57
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Because it was too complicated

2611
01:28:57 --> 01:28:59
<v MR. ALEXANDER>for an online seller like amazon

2612
01:28:59 --> 01:29:02
<v MR. ALEXANDER>or catalogue seller to figure

2613
01:29:02 --> 01:29:03
<v MR. ALEXANDER>out what could the sales tax be

2614
01:29:03 --> 01:29:06
<v MR. ALEXANDER>in tennessee and how much do

2615
01:29:06 --> 01:29:08
<v MR. ALEXANDER>have you to add on in

2616
01:29:08 --> 01:29:09
<v MR. ALEXANDER>merrillville which is town I

2617
01:29:09 --> 01:29:10
<v MR. ALEXANDER>live in?

2618
01:29:10 --> 01:29:11
<v MR. ALEXANDER>20 years ago I might have agreed

2619
01:29:11 --> 01:29:14
<v MR. ALEXANDER>to with that but today

2620
01:29:14 --> 01:29:15
<v MR. ALEXANDER>technology has made it easy for

2621
01:29:15 --> 01:29:17
<v MR. ALEXANDER>catalogue sellers or online

2622
01:29:17 --> 01:29:19
<v MR. ALEXANDER>sellers to do the same thing

2623
01:29:19 --> 01:29:19
<v MR. ALEXANDER>main street sellers are required

2624
01:29:19 --> 01:29:21
<v MR. ALEXANDER>to do.

2625
01:29:21 --> 01:29:22
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Let me give you an example.

2626
01:29:22 --> 01:29:24
<v MR. ALEXANDER>This morning I wanted to know

2627
01:29:24 --> 01:29:25
<v MR. ALEXANDER>what the weather was in my

2628
01:29:25 --> 01:29:27
<v MR. ALEXANDER>hometown in tennessee.

2629
01:29:27 --> 01:29:29
<v MR. ALEXANDER>So I opened my computer up, i

2630
01:29:29 --> 01:29:31
<v MR. ALEXANDER>went to google, I typed in my

2631
01:29:31 --> 01:29:33
<v MR. ALEXANDER>zip code, I typed in weather

2632
01:29:33 --> 01:29:37
<v MR. ALEXANDER>and it told me the weather.

2633
01:29:37 --> 01:29:39
<v MR. ALEXANDER>The software now exists to

2634
01:29:39 --> 01:29:43
<v MR. ALEXANDER>provide to catalogue sellers or

2635
01:29:43 --> 01:29:44
<v MR. ALEXANDER>online sellers the same sort of

2636
01:29:44 --> 01:29:46
<v MR. ALEXANDER>easy way to figure out what the

2637
01:29:46 --> 01:29:53
<v MR. ALEXANDER>sales tax is if I were to buy a

2638
01:29:53 --> 01:29:55
<v MR. ALEXANDER>tv set online in herleville --

2639
01:29:55 --> 01:29:57
<v MR. ALEXANDER>merrillville, tennessee, they

2640
01:29:57 --> 01:29:58
<v MR. ALEXANDER>can type in the price and it

2641
01:29:58 --> 01:30:00
<v MR. ALEXANDER>would tell them tax.

2642
01:30:00 --> 01:30:01
<v MR. ALEXANDER>They could even send the tax on

2643
01:30:01 --> 01:30:02
<v MR. ALEXANDER>to the state.

2644
01:30:02 --> 01:30:05
<v MR. ALEXANDER>In fact, it's about as easy

2645
01:30:05 --> 01:30:06
<v MR. ALEXANDER>with this software that's under

2646
01:30:06 --> 01:30:08
<v MR. ALEXANDER>our law going to have to be

2647
01:30:08 --> 01:30:09
<v MR. ALEXANDER>provided to anybody out of

2648
01:30:09 --> 01:30:10
<v MR. ALEXANDER>state, about as easy for them

2649
01:30:10 --> 01:30:12
<v MR. ALEXANDER>to find out what the tax is as

2650
01:30:12 --> 01:30:13
<v MR. ALEXANDER>it would be for the national

2651
01:30:13 --> 01:30:15
<v MR. ALEXANDER>boot company when somebody walks

2652
01:30:16 --> 01:30:17
<v MR. ALEXANDER>in and tries on the boots in

2653
01:30:17 --> 01:30:19
<v MR. ALEXANDER>nashville.

2654
01:30:19 --> 01:30:21
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Some people have asked why

2655
01:30:21 --> 01:30:22
<v MR. ALEXANDER>should congress get involved in

2656
01:30:22 --> 01:30:25
<v MR. ALEXANDER>this?

2657
01:30:25 --> 01:30:27
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Because nothing is presenting

2658
01:30:27 --> 01:30:27
<v MR. ALEXANDER>states from collecting those

2659
01:30:27 --> 01:30:27
<v MR. ALEXANDER>taxes.

2660
01:30:27 --> 01:30:31
<v MR. ALEXANDER>That's true.

2661
01:30:31 --> 01:30:33
<v MR. ALEXANDER>if I were to buy my boots in

2662
01:30:33 --> 01:30:35
<v MR. ALEXANDER>nashville and -- online and not

2663
01:30:35 --> 01:30:36
<v MR. ALEXANDER>pay the sales tax, the governor

2664
01:30:36 --> 01:30:38
<v MR. ALEXANDER>could come knocking on my door

2665
01:30:38 --> 01:30:43
<v MR. ALEXANDER>and add on the nine cents or

2666
01:30:43 --> 01:30:44
<v MR. ALEXANDER>whatever it is, 9% onto the

2667
01:30:44 --> 01:30:45
<v MR. ALEXANDER>purchase price of the boots.

2668
01:30:45 --> 01:30:47
<v MR. ALEXANDER>But that's not going to happen

2669
01:30:47 --> 01:30:50
<v MR. ALEXANDER>in a practical world.

2670
01:30:50 --> 01:30:51
<v MR. ALEXANDER>The state can't do that for

2671
01:30:51 --> 01:30:54
<v MR. ALEXANDER>millions of purchases that are

2672
01:30:54 --> 01:30:55
<v MR. ALEXANDER>made every year on line, and no

2673
01:30:55 --> 01:30:57
<v MR. ALEXANDER>one wants the governor and his

2674
01:30:57 --> 01:30:57
<v MR. ALEXANDER>agents knocking on our doors

2675
01:30:57 --> 01:31:00
<v MR. ALEXANDER>about today.

2676
01:31:00 --> 01:31:01
<v MR. ALEXANDER>So there's a simpler way to do

2677
01:31:01 --> 01:31:02
<v MR. ALEXANDER>it.

2678
01:31:02 --> 01:31:05
<v MR. ALEXANDER>And congress should make it easy

2679
01:31:05 --> 01:31:06
<v MR. ALEXANDER>for states to be able to do

2680
01:31:06 --> 01:31:09
<v MR. ALEXANDER>that, because we should

2681
01:31:09 --> 01:31:11
<v MR. ALEXANDER>recognize the loophole is

2682
01:31:11 --> 01:31:13
<v MR. ALEXANDER>unfair, that it's

2683
01:31:13 --> 01:31:14
<v MR. ALEXANDER>anticompetitive and it's

2684
01:31:14 --> 01:31:16
<v MR. ALEXANDER>distorting the marketplace.

2685
01:31:16 --> 01:31:17
<v MR. ALEXANDER>As a

2686
01:31:17 --> 01:31:18
<v MR. ALEXANDER>republican senator, I believe

2687
01:31:18 --> 01:31:20
<v MR. ALEXANDER>our party should oppose

2688
01:31:20 --> 01:31:22
<v MR. ALEXANDER>government policies that prefer

2689
01:31:22 --> 01:31:24
<v MR. ALEXANDER>some businesses over other

2690
01:31:24 --> 01:31:26
<v MR. ALEXANDER>businesses and some taxpayers

2691
01:31:26 --> 01:31:29
<v MR. ALEXANDER>over other taxpayers, and I

2692
01:31:29 --> 01:31:30
<v MR. ALEXANDER>believe in states' rights.

2693
01:31:30 --> 01:31:33
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Our bill gives states the right

2694
01:31:33 --> 01:31:33
<v MR. ALEXANDER>to make decisions for

2695
01:31:33 --> 01:31:35
<v MR. ALEXANDER>themselves.

2696
01:31:35 --> 01:31:37
<v MR. ALEXANDER>If illinois or tennessee or

2697
01:31:37 --> 01:31:38
<v MR. ALEXANDER>california wants to prefer some

2698
01:31:38 --> 01:31:40
<v MR. ALEXANDER>businesses over others, wants to

2699
01:31:40 --> 01:31:41
<v MR. ALEXANDER>prefer some taxpayers over

2700
01:31:41 --> 01:31:43
<v MR. ALEXANDER>others, they can do that.

2701
01:31:43 --> 01:31:45
<v MR. ALEXANDER>That's their state's right, but

2702
01:31:45 --> 01:31:46
<v MR. ALEXANDER>we ought to make it possible for

2703
01:31:46 --> 01:31:50
<v MR. ALEXANDER>them not to do that.

2704
01:31:50 --> 01:31:54
<v MR. ALEXANDER>A number of conservatives have

2705
01:31:54 --> 01:31:55
<v MR. ALEXANDER>been outspoken supporters for

2706
01:31:55 --> 01:31:57
<v MR. ALEXANDER>our legislation.

2707
01:31:57 --> 01:31:58
<v MR. ALEXANDER>At times, mforts were reluctant

2708
01:31:58 --> 01:32:00
<v MR. ALEXANDER>to support it over the years

2709
01:32:00 --> 01:32:02
<v MR. ALEXANDER>because it was complicated and

2710
01:32:02 --> 01:32:04
<v MR. ALEXANDER>because it -- quote -- sounded

2711
01:32:04 --> 01:32:06
<v MR. ALEXANDER>like a -- quote -- tax.

2712
01:32:06 --> 01:32:09
<v MR. ALEXANDER>It's about a tax but it's a tax

2713
01:32:09 --> 01:32:11
<v MR. ALEXANDER>that's already owed.

2714
01:32:11 --> 01:32:13
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Here is what the head of the

2715
01:32:13 --> 01:32:13
<v MR. ALEXANDER>chairman of the american

2716
01:32:13 --> 01:32:15
<v MR. ALEXANDER>conservative union says.

2717
01:32:15 --> 01:32:16
<v MR. ALEXANDER>He supports our legislation.

2718
01:32:16 --> 01:32:17
<v MR. ALEXANDER>He says -- quote -- &quot;there is

2719
01:32:17 --> 01:32:19
<v MR. ALEXANDER>no more glaring example of

2720
01:32:19 --> 01:32:21
<v MR. ALEXANDER>misguided government power than

2721
01:32:21 --> 01:32:23
<v MR. ALEXANDER>when taxes or regulations affect

2722
01:32:23 --> 01:32:26
<v MR. ALEXANDER>two similar businesses

2723
01:32:26 --> 01:32:26
<v MR. ALEXANDER>completely differently.&quot;

2724
01:32:26 --> 01:32:28
<v MR. ALEXANDER>unquote.

2725
01:32:28 --> 01:32:29
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Governor haley barbour also

2726
01:32:29 --> 01:32:31
<v MR. ALEXANDER>supports our bill.

2727
01:32:31 --> 01:32:32
<v MR. ALEXANDER>He said -- &quot;there is simply no

2728
01:32:32 --> 01:32:34
<v MR. ALEXANDER>longer a compelling reason for

2729
01:32:34 --> 01:32:36
<v MR. ALEXANDER>government to continue giving

2730
01:32:36 --> 01:32:38
<v MR. ALEXANDER>online retailers special

2731
01:32:38 --> 01:32:39
<v MR. ALEXANDER>treatment over small

2732
01:32:39 --> 01:32:40
<v MR. ALEXANDER>businesses.&quot;

2733
01:32:40 --> 01:32:44
<v MR. ALEXANDER>governor mitch daniels of

2734
01:32:44 --> 01:32:48
<v MR. ALEXANDER>indiana said a similar thing.

2735
01:32:48 --> 01:32:49
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Congressman mike pence of

2736
01:32:49 --> 01:32:49
<v MR. ALEXANDER>indiana said -- quote -- &quot;I

2737
01:32:49 --> 01:32:51
<v MR. ALEXANDER>don't think congress should be

2738
01:32:51 --> 01:32:53
<v MR. ALEXANDER>in the business of picking

2739
01:32:53 --> 01:32:54
<v MR. ALEXANDER>winners and losers.

2740
01:32:54 --> 01:32:56
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Inaction by congress today

2741
01:32:56 --> 01:32:59
<v MR. ALEXANDER>results in a system that does

2742
01:32:59 --> 01:33:02
<v MR. ALEXANDER>pick winners and losers.&quot;

2743
01:33:02 --> 01:33:02
<v MR. ALEXANDER>that's what mike pence had to

2744
01:33:02 --> 01:33:05
<v MR. ALEXANDER>say.

2745
01:33:05 --> 01:33:07
<v MR. ALEXANDER>At cpac this past weekend, a

2746
01:33:07 --> 01:33:09
<v MR. ALEXANDER>gathering of conservative

2747
01:33:09 --> 01:33:11
<v MR. ALEXANDER>activists, there was a panel of

2748
01:33:11 --> 01:33:15
<v MR. ALEXANDER>leaders and industry experts

2749
01:33:15 --> 01:33:16
<v MR. ALEXANDER>about this legislation, and the

2750
01:33:16 --> 01:33:18
<v MR. ALEXANDER>general agreement was that

2751
01:33:18 --> 01:33:18
<v MR. ALEXANDER>congress should act to solve the

2752
01:33:18 --> 01:33:20
<v MR. ALEXANDER>problem.

2753
01:33:20 --> 01:33:22
<v MR. ALEXANDER>The solution, the panelists

2754
01:33:22 --> 01:33:23
<v MR. ALEXANDER>said, should be fair, something

2755
01:33:23 --> 01:33:25
<v MR. ALEXANDER>people can understand and meet

2756
01:33:25 --> 01:33:26
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the needs of states, consumers

2757
01:33:26 --> 01:33:29
<v MR. ALEXANDER>and retailers.

2758
01:33:29 --> 01:33:31
<v MR. ALEXANDER>I believe our legislation

2759
01:33:31 --> 01:33:33
<v MR. ALEXANDER>accomplishes all these goals.

2760
01:33:33 --> 01:33:35
<v MR. ALEXANDER>In the first place, it's a

2761
01:33:35 --> 01:33:38
<v MR. ALEXANDER>rarity in federal legislation.

2762
01:33:38 --> 01:33:40
<v MR. ALEXANDER>It is only ten pages long.

2763
01:33:40 --> 01:33:41
<v MR. ALEXANDER>You can actually read it in a

2764
01:33:41 --> 01:33:42
<v MR. ALEXANDER>few minutes.

2765
01:33:42 --> 01:33:45
<v MR. ALEXANDER>It's fair because it gives

2766
01:33:45 --> 01:33:49
<v MR. ALEXANDER>states the right to decide for

2767
01:33:49 --> 01:33:50
<v MR. ALEXANDER>themselves how to enforce the

2768
01:33:50 --> 01:33:51
<v MR. ALEXANDER>state's own laws.

2769
01:33:51 --> 01:33:55
<v MR. ALEXANDER>It protects businesses and

2770
01:33:55 --> 01:33:58
<v MR. ALEXANDER>consumers by requiring states to

2771
01:33:58 --> 01:33:59
<v MR. ALEXANDER>adopt business simple basic

2772
01:33:59 --> 01:33:59
<v MR. ALEXANDER>simplifications.

2773
01:33:59 --> 01:34:01
<v MR. ALEXANDER>I'm talking about the software

2774
01:34:01 --> 01:34:03
<v MR. ALEXANDER>that you could give to amazon so

2775
01:34:03 --> 01:34:05
<v MR. ALEXANDER>it could figure out in an

2776
01:34:05 --> 01:34:08
<v MR. ALEXANDER>instant what the tax on my tv

2777
01:34:08 --> 01:34:11
<v MR. ALEXANDER>set is if I buy a tv set online

2778
01:34:11 --> 01:34:12
<v MR. ALEXANDER>from amazon, and it exempts

2779
01:34:12 --> 01:34:16
<v MR. ALEXANDER>small businesses that sell for

2780
01:34:16 --> 01:34:18
<v MR. ALEXANDER>less than $500,000 a year remote

2781
01:34:18 --> 01:34:19
<v MR. ALEXANDER>sales each year.

2782
01:34:20 --> 01:34:21
<v MR. ALEXANDER>That's very important.

2783
01:34:21 --> 01:34:22
<v MR. ALEXANDER>I use the example of the

2784
01:34:22 --> 01:34:25
<v MR. ALEXANDER>national boot company.

2785
01:34:25 --> 01:34:26
<v MR. ALEXANDER>He sells online and he sells out

2786
01:34:26 --> 01:34:28
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the front door.

2787
01:34:28 --> 01:34:32
<v MR. ALEXANDER>He said never in his history has

2788
01:34:32 --> 01:34:35
<v MR. ALEXANDER>he sold more than $400,000 worth

2789
01:34:35 --> 01:34:37
<v MR. ALEXANDER>of revenue from his boot sales

2790
01:34:37 --> 01:34:38
<v MR. ALEXANDER>online, and when he began, he at

2791
01:34:38 --> 01:34:40
<v MR. ALEXANDER>least was one of the larger

2792
01:34:40 --> 01:34:43
<v MR. ALEXANDER>sellers of boots online.

2793
01:34:43 --> 01:34:45
<v MR. ALEXANDER>So the $500,000 exemption for

2794
01:34:45 --> 01:34:48
<v MR. ALEXANDER>small businesses from this

2795
01:34:48 --> 01:34:49
<v MR. ALEXANDER>legislation should go a long way

2796
01:34:49 --> 01:34:51
<v MR. ALEXANDER>to meet the concerns of those

2797
01:34:51 --> 01:34:53
<v MR. ALEXANDER>senators on both sides who want

2798
01:34:53 --> 01:34:58
<v MR. ALEXANDER>to make sure we don't impose

2799
01:34:58 --> 01:35:00
<v MR. ALEXANDER>some sort of new rule on very

2800
01:35:00 --> 01:35:02
<v MR. ALEXANDER>small entrepreneurs.

2801
01:35:02 --> 01:35:03
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Another reason congress should

2802
01:35:03 --> 01:35:05
<v MR. ALEXANDER>act now is that states and local

2803
01:35:05 --> 01:35:06
<v MR. ALEXANDER>governments will lose an

2804
01:35:06 --> 01:35:08
<v MR. ALEXANDER>estimated $23 billion in

2805
01:35:08 --> 01:35:11
<v MR. ALEXANDER>collected sales tax revenue in

2806
01:35:11 --> 01:35:12
<v MR. ALEXANDER>2012 just because of this

2807
01:35:12 --> 01:35:14
<v MR. ALEXANDER>loophole.

2808
01:35:14 --> 01:35:17
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Here's what former governor jeb

2809
01:35:17 --> 01:35:18
<v MR. ALEXANDER>bush had to say about that --

2810
01:35:18 --> 01:35:20
<v MR. ALEXANDER>quote -- &quot;it seems to me there

2811
01:35:20 --> 01:35:22
<v MR. ALEXANDER>has to be a way to tax sales

2812
01:35:22 --> 01:35:26
<v MR. ALEXANDER>done online in the same way that

2813
01:35:26 --> 01:35:27
<v MR. ALEXANDER>sales are taxed in

2814
01:35:27 --> 01:35:28
<v MR. ALEXANDER>brick-and-mortar establishments.

2815
01:35:28 --> 01:35:29
<v MR. ALEXANDER>My guess is there would be

2816
01:35:29 --> 01:35:32
<v MR. ALEXANDER>hundreds of millions of dollars

2817
01:35:32 --> 01:35:35
<v MR. ALEXANDER>that could then be used to

2818
01:35:35 --> 01:35:36
<v MR. ALEXANDER>reduce taxes to fill campaign

2819
01:35:36 --> 01:35:39
<v MR. ALEXANDER>promises.&quot;

2820
01:35:39 --> 01:35:41
<v MR. ALEXANDER>uncollected sales taxes could be

2821
01:35:41 --> 01:35:43
<v MR. ALEXANDER>used to pay for things our

2822
01:35:43 --> 01:35:46
<v MR. ALEXANDER>states need to pay for now.

2823
01:35:46 --> 01:35:47
<v MR. ALEXANDER>They could be used to reduce

2824
01:35:47 --> 01:35:49
<v MR. ALEXANDER>college tuition.

2825
01:35:49 --> 01:35:51
<v MR. ALEXANDER>They could be used to pay

2826
01:35:51 --> 01:35:52
<v MR. ALEXANDER>outstanding teachers, but they

2827
01:35:52 --> 01:35:54
<v MR. ALEXANDER>also could be used to reduce the

2828
01:35:54 --> 01:35:57
<v MR. ALEXANDER>sales tax rate or to reduce some

2829
01:35:57 --> 01:35:57
<v MR. ALEXANDER>other tax or to avoid a tax

2830
01:35:57 --> 01:35:58
<v MR. ALEXANDER>altogether.

2831
01:35:58 --> 01:36:00
<v MR. ALEXANDER>In tennessee, where we don't

2832
01:36:00 --> 01:36:04
<v MR. ALEXANDER>have a state income tax, we'd

2833
01:36:04 --> 01:36:05
<v MR. ALEXANDER>like to avoid one.

2834
01:36:05 --> 01:36:08
<v MR. ALEXANDER>State income tax are probably

2835
01:36:08 --> 01:36:09
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the worst words in our

2836
01:36:09 --> 01:36:11
<v MR. ALEXANDER>vocabulary.

2837
01:36:11 --> 01:36:12
<v MR. ALEXANDER>And collecting tax on the sales

2838
01:36:12 --> 01:36:14
<v MR. ALEXANDER>from everybody that owes us

2839
01:36:14 --> 01:36:16
<v MR. ALEXANDER>could not only reduce our sales

2840
01:36:16 --> 01:36:19
<v MR. ALEXANDER>tax but help us avoid a state

2841
01:36:19 --> 01:36:20
<v MR. ALEXANDER>income tax.

2842
01:36:20 --> 01:36:21
<v MR. ALEXANDER>The governor of tennessee who

2843
01:36:21 --> 01:36:22
<v MR. ALEXANDER>strongly supports our

2844
01:36:22 --> 01:36:24
<v MR. ALEXANDER>legislation said it's just too

2845
01:36:24 --> 01:36:27
<v MR. ALEXANDER>big a piece of our economy now

2846
01:36:27 --> 01:36:29
<v MR. ALEXANDER>to treat it like we did 20 years

2847
01:36:29 --> 01:36:31
<v MR. ALEXANDER>ago.

2848
01:36:31 --> 01:36:32
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Governor haslem is right.

2849
01:36:32 --> 01:36:34
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Online sales set new records

2850
01:36:34 --> 01:36:36
<v MR. ALEXANDER>last year, and while the growth

2851
01:36:36 --> 01:36:37
<v MR. ALEXANDER>of e-commerce is very good news

2852
01:36:37 --> 01:36:38
<v MR. ALEXANDER>for our economy, our local

2853
01:36:38 --> 01:36:39
<v MR. ALEXANDER>businesses are getting hurt

2854
01:36:39 --> 01:36:41
<v MR. ALEXANDER>because they are not competing

2855
01:36:41 --> 01:36:42
<v MR. ALEXANDER>on a level playing field.

2856
01:36:42 --> 01:36:44
<v MR. ALEXANDER>That's why our legislation has

2857
01:36:44 --> 01:36:46
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the support of the national

2858
01:36:46 --> 01:36:48
<v MR. ALEXANDER>governors' association, the

2859
01:36:48 --> 01:36:50
<v MR. ALEXANDER>national conference of state

2860
01:36:50 --> 01:36:51
<v MR. ALEXANDER>legislatures, the conference of

2861
01:36:51 --> 01:36:53
<v MR. ALEXANDER>mayors, the national association

2862
01:36:53 --> 01:36:55
<v MR. ALEXANDER>of counties, just to name a few.

2863
01:36:55 --> 01:36:58
<v MR. ALEXANDER>About the only ones left who are

2864
01:36:58 --> 01:37:00
<v MR. ALEXANDER>complaining about our

2865
01:37:00 --> 01:37:01
<v MR. ALEXANDER>legislation are taxpayers and

2866
01:37:01 --> 01:37:02
<v MR. ALEXANDER>businesses who are being

2867
01:37:02 --> 01:37:04
<v MR. ALEXANDER>subsidized by other taxpayers

2868
01:37:04 --> 01:37:07
<v MR. ALEXANDER>and businesses because the

2869
01:37:07 --> 01:37:10
<v MR. ALEXANDER>playing field isn't level.

2870
01:37:10 --> 01:37:12
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Amazon, a huge online seller,

2871
01:37:12 --> 01:37:13
<v MR. ALEXANDER>strongly supports our

2872
01:37:13 --> 01:37:13
<v MR. ALEXANDER>legislation.

2873
01:37:13 --> 01:37:15
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Over the years, they have

2874
01:37:15 --> 01:37:17
<v MR. ALEXANDER>opposed legislation like this.

2875
01:37:17 --> 01:37:18
<v MR. ALEXANDER>now they believe we have solved

2876
01:37:18 --> 01:37:18
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the problem.

2877
01:37:18 --> 01:37:20
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Why?

2878
01:37:20 --> 01:37:23
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Because they say our bill makes

2879
01:37:23 --> 01:37:25
<v MR. ALEXANDER>it easy for consumers and easy

2880
01:37:25 --> 01:37:28
<v MR. ALEXANDER>for retailers to comply with

2881
01:37:28 --> 01:37:29
<v MR. ALEXANDER>state sales tax laws, and it

2882
01:37:29 --> 01:37:34
<v MR. ALEXANDER>helps states without raising

2883
01:37:34 --> 01:37:35
<v MR. ALEXANDER>taxes or new federal spending.

2884
01:37:35 --> 01:37:37
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Some people will tell you we're

2885
01:37:37 --> 01:37:37
<v MR. ALEXANDER>talking about taxing the

2886
01:37:37 --> 01:37:38
<v MR. ALEXANDER>internet.

2887
01:37:38 --> 01:37:39
<v MR. ALEXANDER>That's not true.

2888
01:37:39 --> 01:37:41
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Our legislation doesn't create a

2889
01:37:41 --> 01:37:41
<v MR. ALEXANDER>new tax, it doesn't tax the

2890
01:37:41 --> 01:37:44
<v MR. ALEXANDER>internet.

2891
01:37:44 --> 01:37:45
<v MR. ALEXANDER>The senate debated internet

2892
01:37:45 --> 01:37:46
<v MR. ALEXANDER>access taxes several years ago.

2893
01:37:46 --> 01:37:47
<v MR. ALEXANDER>I was in the middle of the

2894
01:37:47 --> 01:37:49
<v MR. ALEXANDER>debate.

2895
01:37:49 --> 01:37:50
<v MR. ALEXANDER>It led to a moratorium on

2896
01:37:50 --> 01:37:52
<v MR. ALEXANDER>internet access taxes.

2897
01:37:52 --> 01:37:52
<v MR. ALEXANDER>That moratorium is still in

2898
01:37:52 --> 01:37:54
<v MR. ALEXANDER>effect today.

2899
01:37:54 --> 01:37:57
<v MR. ALEXANDER>So we're talking about a tax or

2900
01:37:57 --> 01:38:00
<v MR. ALEXANDER>taxes that already are the law,

2901
01:38:00 --> 01:38:03
<v MR. ALEXANDER>and we're talking about an

2902
01:38:03 --> 01:38:05
<v MR. ALEXANDER>internet sales tax -- an

2903
01:38:05 --> 01:38:07
<v MR. ALEXANDER>internet access moratorium tax

2904
01:38:07 --> 01:38:08
<v MR. ALEXANDER>which will stay in place and not

2905
01:38:08 --> 01:38:09
<v MR. ALEXANDER>be altered.

2906
01:38:09 --> 01:38:11
<v MR. ALEXANDER>It's very hard to see how anyone

2907
01:38:11 --> 01:38:12
<v MR. ALEXANDER>can say with a straight face

2908
01:38:12 --> 01:38:14
<v MR. ALEXANDER>that giving states the right to

2909
01:38:14 --> 01:38:16
<v MR. ALEXANDER>collect taxes that are already

2910
01:38:16 --> 01:38:17
<v MR. ALEXANDER>owed is a tax increase.

2911
01:38:17 --> 01:38:19
<v MR. ALEXANDER>i spent a lot of time talking

2912
01:38:19 --> 01:38:20
<v MR. ALEXANDER>with my colleagues about making

2913
01:38:20 --> 01:38:21
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the senate work more

2914
01:38:21 --> 01:38:22
<v MR. ALEXANDER>effectively.

2915
01:38:22 --> 01:38:24
<v MR. ALEXANDER>One way to do that is to make

2916
01:38:24 --> 01:38:26
<v MR. ALEXANDER>sure that senators have the

2917
01:38:26 --> 01:38:28
<v MR. ALEXANDER>opportunity to thoroughly

2918
01:38:28 --> 01:38:31
<v MR. ALEXANDER>consider important legislation.

2919
01:38:31 --> 01:38:34
<v MR. ALEXANDER>On January 31, just a few weeks

2920
01:38:34 --> 01:38:36
<v MR. ALEXANDER>ago, over 200 businesses, state

2921
01:38:36 --> 01:38:37
<v MR. ALEXANDER>and national trade associations,

2922
01:38:37 --> 01:38:38
<v MR. ALEXANDER>sent a letter to the senator

2923
01:38:38 --> 01:38:39
<v MR. ALEXANDER>from montana, the Chairman Of

2924
01:38:39 --> 01:38:41
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the finance committee, asking

2925
01:38:41 --> 01:38:45
<v MR. ALEXANDER>him to cosponsor our bill to

2926
01:38:45 --> 01:38:47
<v MR. ALEXANDER>address the inequity this year.

2927
01:38:47 --> 01:38:49
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Senator enzi and the bill's

2928
01:38:49 --> 01:38:50
<v MR. ALEXANDER>cosponsors have also urged the

2929
01:38:50 --> 01:38:53
<v MR. ALEXANDER>senate finance committee to hold

2930
01:38:53 --> 01:38:53
<v MR. ALEXANDER>a hearing on our bill as soon as

2931
01:38:53 --> 01:38:54
<v MR. ALEXANDER>possible.

2932
01:38:54 --> 01:38:56
<v MR. ALEXANDER>The house judiciary committee

2933
01:38:56 --> 01:38:58
<v MR. ALEXANDER>has already held a hearing.

2934
01:38:58 --> 01:39:00
<v MR. ALEXANDER>they did it on November 30.

2935
01:39:00 --> 01:39:01
<v MR. ALEXANDER>It gave house members of both

2936
01:39:01 --> 01:39:02
<v MR. ALEXANDER>political parties the

2937
01:39:02 --> 01:39:03
<v MR. ALEXANDER>opportunity to learn more about

2938
01:39:04 --> 01:39:06
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the issue and express their

2939
01:39:06 --> 01:39:08
<v MR. ALEXANDER>support for it, and I hope that

2940
01:39:08 --> 01:39:10
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the senate finance committee

2941
01:39:10 --> 01:39:11
<v MR. ALEXANDER>will seriously consider our

2942
01:39:11 --> 01:39:13
<v MR. ALEXANDER>request and soon find time so

2943
01:39:13 --> 01:39:14
<v MR. ALEXANDER>that senators can have the same

2944
01:39:14 --> 01:39:16
<v MR. ALEXANDER>opportunity that house members

2945
01:39:16 --> 01:39:19
<v MR. ALEXANDER>have had.

2946
01:39:19 --> 01:39:21
<v MR. ALEXANDER>ten years ago, the bills that we

2947
01:39:21 --> 01:39:24
<v MR. ALEXANDER>considered to try to close this

2948
01:39:24 --> 01:39:26
<v MR. ALEXANDER>loophole and fix this problem

2949
01:39:26 --> 01:39:26
<v MR. ALEXANDER>simply weren't adequate to solve

2950
01:39:26 --> 01:39:28
<v MR. ALEXANDER>the problem.

2951
01:39:28 --> 01:39:30
<v MR. ALEXANDER>The legislation that we

2952
01:39:30 --> 01:39:31
<v MR. ALEXANDER>introduced in November does

2953
01:39:31 --> 01:39:33
<v MR. ALEXANDER>solve the problem.

2954
01:39:33 --> 01:39:36
<v MR. ALEXANDER>It is simple, it's about state

2955
01:39:36 --> 01:39:37
<v MR. ALEXANDER>rights, it's about fairness and

2956
01:39:37 --> 01:39:39
<v MR. ALEXANDER>it solves the problem.

2957
01:39:39 --> 01:39:40
<v MR. ALEXANDER>it doesn't cost the federal

2958
01:39:40 --> 01:39:42
<v MR. ALEXANDER>government a dime.

2959
01:39:42 --> 01:39:42
<v MR. ALEXANDER>It doesn't change federal tax

2960
01:39:42 --> 01:39:44
<v MR. ALEXANDER>laws.

2961
01:39:44 --> 01:39:44
<v MR. ALEXANDER>It doesn't change state tax

2962
01:39:44 --> 01:39:46
<v MR. ALEXANDER>laws.

2963
01:39:46 --> 01:39:46
<v MR. ALEXANDER>It doesn't require states to do

2964
01:39:46 --> 01:39:48
<v MR. ALEXANDER>anything.

2965
01:39:48 --> 01:39:50
<v MR. ALEXANDER>It simply gives states the right

2966
01:39:50 --> 01:39:51
<v MR. ALEXANDER>to decide for themselves how to

2967
01:39:51 --> 01:39:54
<v MR. ALEXANDER>enforce their own laws.

2968
01:39:54 --> 01:39:56
<v MR. ALEXANDER>This is a 20-year-old law that

2969
01:39:56 --> 01:39:59
<v MR. ALEXANDER>only the federal government can

2970
01:39:59 --> 01:39:59
<v MR. ALEXANDER>solve unless we act -- can

2971
01:39:59 --> 01:40:00
<v MR. ALEXANDER>solve.

2972
01:40:00 --> 01:40:02
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Unless we act, states will

2973
01:40:02 --> 01:40:04
<v MR. ALEXANDER>continue to be deprived of their

2974
01:40:04 --> 01:40:05
<v MR. ALEXANDER>right to enforce their own tax

2975
01:40:05 --> 01:40:07
<v MR. ALEXANDER>laws, and businesses will not be

2976
01:40:07 --> 01:40:08
<v MR. ALEXANDER>allowed to compete on a level

2977
01:40:08 --> 01:40:10
<v MR. ALEXANDER>playing field.

2978
01:40:10 --> 01:40:13
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Mr. President, I would ask

2979
01:40:13 --> 01:40:19
<v MR. ALEXANDER>consent to include following my

2980
01:40:19 --> 01:40:22
<v MR. ALEXANDER>remarks a letter to Chairman

2981
01:40:22 --> 01:40:25
<v MR. ALEXANDER>Baucus and ranking member hatch

2982
01:40:25 --> 01:40:26
<v MR. ALEXANDER>from the ten senate bipartisan

2983
01:40:26 --> 01:40:30
<v MR. ALEXANDER>cosponsors of this legislation

2984
01:40:30 --> 01:40:33
<v MR. ALEXANDER>of January 31 asking for a

2985
01:40:33 --> 01:40:37
<v MR. ALEXANDER>hearing on the market fairness

2986
01:40:37 --> 01:40:39
<v MR. ALEXANDER>act, a memo outlining quotes

2987
01:40:39 --> 01:40:42
<v MR. ALEXANDER>from conservative voices on

2988
01:40:42 --> 01:40:45
<v MR. ALEXANDER>e-fairness, and another memo

2989
01:40:45 --> 01:40:47
<v MR. ALEXANDER>entitled &quot;support for the

01:40:47 --> 01:40:49

01:40:49 --> 01:40:50
<v MR. ALEXANDER>conservative political action

2992
01:40:50 --> 01:40:50
<v MR. ALEXANDER>conference.&quot;

2993
01:40:50 --> 01:40:51
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>is there

2994
01:40:51 --> 01:40:52
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection?

2995
01:40:52 --> 01:40:53
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>So ordered.

2996
01:40:53 --> 01:40:54
<v MR. ALEXANDER>I thank the

2997
01:40:54 --> 01:40:56
<v MR. ALEXANDER>President And I yield the floor

2998
01:40:56 --> 01:40:56
<v MR. ALEXANDER>and I notice the absence of a

2999
01:40:56 --> 01:40:57
<v MR. ALEXANDER>quorum.

3000
01:40:57 --> 01:41:00
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the clerk

3001
01:41:00 --> 01:41:01
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>will call the roll.

3002
01:48:48 --> 01:48:50
<v MRS. BOXER>Mr. President, I

3003
01:48:50 --> 01:48:51
<v MRS. BOXER>ask that the quorum call be

3004
01:48:51 --> 01:48:51
<v MRS. BOXER>dispensed with.

3005
01:48:51 --> 01:48:52
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

3006
01:48:52 --> 01:48:53
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection, so ordered.

3007
01:48:53 --> 01:48:55
<v MRS. BOXER>Mr. President, we

3008
01:48:55 --> 01:48:57
<v MRS. BOXER>have on the floor of the united

3009
01:48:57 --> 01:49:00
<v MRS. BOXER>states senate the transportation

3010
01:49:00 --> 01:49:02
<v MRS. BOXER>bill, and you might wonder why a

3011
01:49:02 --> 01:49:05
<v MRS. BOXER>bill that is the number-one jobs

3012
01:49:05 --> 01:49:06
<v MRS. BOXER>bill that we can do here is

3013
01:49:06 --> 01:49:08
<v MRS. BOXER>moving so slowly.

3014
01:49:08 --> 01:49:10
<v MRS. BOXER>You might wonder.

3015
01:49:10 --> 01:49:12
<v MRS. BOXER>Any norpal person would wonder

3016
01:49:12 --> 01:49:15
<v MRS. BOXER>why a bill that is so popular

3017
01:49:15 --> 01:49:16
<v MRS. BOXER>that it has everyone from the

3018
01:49:16 --> 01:49:18
<v MRS. BOXER>afl-cio to the chamber of

3019
01:49:18 --> 01:49:24
<v MRS. BOXER>commerce supporting it is moving

3020
01:49:24 --> 01:49:25
<v MRS. BOXER>so slowly.

3021
01:49:25 --> 01:49:30
<v MRS. BOXER>You miter wonder

3022
01:49:30 --> 01:49:33
<v MRS. BOXER>might wonder why it's moving

3023
01:49:33 --> 01:49:39
<v MRS. BOXER>so slowly since the

3024
01:49:39 --> 01:49:40
<v MRS. BOXER>authorization for all of our

3025
01:49:40 --> 01:49:41
<v MRS. BOXER>funding expires in a month.

3026
01:49:41 --> 01:49:45
<v MRS. BOXER>what is going on?

3027
01:49:45 --> 01:49:47
<v MRS. BOXER>And yesterday I came here and

3028
01:49:47 --> 01:49:50
<v MRS. BOXER>said I didn't see a clear path

3029
01:49:50 --> 01:49:53
<v MRS. BOXER>forward for this bill.

3030
01:49:53 --> 01:49:55
<v MRS. BOXER>And it's very disturbing, and

3031
01:49:55 --> 01:49:58
<v MRS. BOXER>I'll tell you why it's so

3032
01:49:58 --> 01:49:59
<v MRS. BOXER>disturbing, and that is when you

3033
01:49:59 --> 01:50:03
<v MRS. BOXER>look at the construction area of

3034
01:50:03 --> 01:50:07
<v MRS. BOXER>our economy, it is still down.

3035
01:50:07 --> 01:50:09
<v MRS. BOXER>We have -- is it 1.5 million

3036
01:50:09 --> 01:50:12
<v MRS. BOXER>unemployed construction workers?

3037
01:50:12 --> 01:50:13
<v MRS. BOXER>And if you think in your mind's

3038
01:50:13 --> 01:50:17
<v MRS. BOXER>eye what that is, I have a

3039
01:50:17 --> 01:50:20
<v MRS. BOXER>picture here of a stadium during

3040
01:50:20 --> 01:50:21
<v MRS. BOXER>the super bowl.

3041
01:50:21 --> 01:50:24
<v MRS. BOXER>And, Mr. President, you can see

3042
01:50:24 --> 01:50:27
<v MRS. BOXER>this stadium, and I want you to

3043
01:50:27 --> 01:50:29
<v MRS. BOXER>picture everyone sitting in this

3044
01:50:29 --> 01:50:31
<v MRS. BOXER>stadium is an unemployed

3045
01:50:31 --> 01:50:35
<v MRS. BOXER>construction worker, and think

3046
01:50:35 --> 01:50:36
<v MRS. BOXER>about 15 stadiums' full.

3047
01:50:36 --> 01:50:38
<v MRS. BOXER>Yesterday I said it was ten.

3048
01:50:38 --> 01:50:40
<v MRS. BOXER>That was incorrect.

3049
01:50:40 --> 01:50:48
<v MRS. BOXER>I stand corrected today.

3050
01:50:48 --> 01:50:48
<v MRS. BOXER>15 stadiums full of unemployed

3051
01:50:48 --> 01:50:50
<v MRS. BOXER>construction workers just

3052
01:50:50 --> 01:50:51
<v MRS. BOXER>playing that we pass this bill.

3053
01:50:51 --> 01:50:54
<v MRS. BOXER>They are unemployed and this

3054
01:50:54 --> 01:50:54
<v MRS. BOXER>bill will create up to 2.8

3055
01:50:54 --> 01:50:56
<v MRS. BOXER>million.

3056
01:50:56 --> 01:50:58
<v MRS. BOXER>It will save 1.8 million and

3057
01:50:58 --> 01:51:03
<v MRS. BOXER>discrete up to a million.

3058
01:51:03 --> 01:51:05
<v MRS. BOXER>so it will make a huge dent --

3059
01:51:05 --> 01:51:07
<v MRS. BOXER>it will save 1.8 million and

3060
01:51:07 --> 01:51:11
<v MRS. BOXER>create up to a million.

3061
01:51:11 --> 01:51:13
<v MRS. BOXER>So it will make a huge dent.

3062
01:51:13 --> 01:51:14
<v MRS. BOXER>Yesterday I said I didn't see a

3063
01:51:14 --> 01:51:16
<v MRS. BOXER>path forward.

3064
01:51:16 --> 01:51:17
<v MRS. BOXER>But today I see a path forward.

3065
01:51:17 --> 01:51:18
<v MRS. BOXER>There's been some progress

3066
01:51:18 --> 01:51:19
<v MRS. BOXER>overnight, but it isn't as clear

3067
01:51:19 --> 01:51:20
<v MRS. BOXER>as it should be.

3068
01:51:20 --> 01:51:22
<v MRS. BOXER>We asked both sides of the

3069
01:51:22 --> 01:51:24
<v MRS. BOXER>aisle, we said, can you come up

3070
01:51:24 --> 01:51:25
<v MRS. BOXER>with amendments that you feel

3071
01:51:25 --> 01:51:30
<v MRS. BOXER>compelled to offer to this bill

3072
01:51:30 --> 01:51:32
<v MRS. BOXER>and try to keep them related to

3073
01:51:32 --> 01:51:33
<v MRS. BOXER>transportation.

3074
01:51:33 --> 01:51:35
<v MRS. BOXER>Well, the bad news is there's a

3075
01:51:35 --> 01:51:37
<v MRS. BOXER>lot of extraneous amendments

3076
01:51:37 --> 01:51:40
<v MRS. BOXER>that were filed.

3077
01:51:40 --> 01:51:41
<v MRS. BOXER>First and foremost, birth

3078
01:51:41 --> 01:51:43
<v MRS. BOXER>control.

3079
01:51:43 --> 01:51:45
<v MRS. BOXER>birth control.

3080
01:51:45 --> 01:51:48
<v MRS. BOXER>The blunt amendment -- not only

3081
01:51:48 --> 01:51:51
<v MRS. BOXER>does it say that any employer

3082
01:51:51 --> 01:51:52
<v MRS. BOXER>could say they have a moral

3083
01:51:52 --> 01:51:55
<v MRS. BOXER>objection; it doesn't even have

3084
01:51:55 --> 01:51:56
<v MRS. BOXER>to be a religious objection.

3085
01:51:56 --> 01:51:59
<v MRS. BOXER>Any bloir --

3086
01:51:59 --> 01:52:01
<v MRS. BOXER>employer -- so if I'm an

3087
01:52:01 --> 01:52:03
<v MRS. BOXER>employer and I believe in prayer

3088
01:52:03 --> 01:52:06
<v MRS. BOXER>over medicine and I can then

3089
01:52:06 --> 01:52:07
<v MRS. BOXER>deny health care to all my

3090
01:52:07 --> 01:52:10
<v MRS. BOXER>employees.

3091
01:52:10 --> 01:52:12
<v MRS. BOXER>This makes no sense at all.

3092
01:52:12 --> 01:52:14
<v MRS. BOXER>And senator blunt say, well, you

3093
01:52:14 --> 01:52:18
<v MRS. BOXER>could take it to court.

3094
01:52:18 --> 01:52:20
<v MRS. BOXER>Oh, sure... Some low-paid

3095
01:52:20 --> 01:52:21
<v MRS. BOXER>employee is going to take it to

3096
01:52:21 --> 01:52:24
<v MRS. BOXER>court.

3097
01:52:24 --> 01:52:25
<v MRS. BOXER>so we have to deal with this

3098
01:52:25 --> 01:52:26
<v MRS. BOXER>birth control amendment and

3099
01:52:26 --> 01:52:28
<v MRS. BOXER>health care amendment on a

3100
01:52:28 --> 01:52:30
<v MRS. BOXER>highway bill.

3101
01:52:30 --> 01:52:32
<v MRS. BOXER>As I said yesterday, at first

3102
01:52:32 --> 01:52:33
<v MRS. BOXER>when I saw a birth control

3103
01:52:33 --> 01:52:35
<v MRS. BOXER>amendment, I thought maybe it

3104
01:52:35 --> 01:52:36
<v MRS. BOXER>says you can't take your birth

3105
01:52:36 --> 01:52:37
<v MRS. BOXER>control pills when you're on a

3106
01:52:37 --> 01:52:40
<v MRS. BOXER>federal highway.

3107
01:52:40 --> 01:52:43
<v MRS. BOXER>What is going on here?

3108
01:52:43 --> 01:52:45
<v MRS. BOXER>There's no relation, it's

3109
01:52:45 --> 01:52:45
<v MRS. BOXER>bizarre to offer these unrelated

3110
01:52:45 --> 01:52:48
<v MRS. BOXER>amendments.

3111
01:52:48 --> 01:52:49
<v MRS. BOXER>Then we have an amendment on

3112
01:52:49 --> 01:52:50
<v MRS. BOXER>egypt.

3113
01:52:51 --> 01:52:52
<v MRS. BOXER>Now, frankly, I am a ready to

3114
01:52:52 --> 01:52:52
<v MRS. BOXER>vote on the birth control

3115
01:52:52 --> 01:52:55
<v MRS. BOXER>amendment.

3116
01:52:55 --> 01:52:58
<v MRS. BOXER>I'm happy to vote on the egypt

3117
01:52:58 --> 01:53:00
<v MRS. BOXER>amendment, although I believe --

3118
01:53:00 --> 01:53:02
<v MRS. BOXER>this is my own view as a member

3119
01:53:02 --> 01:53:03
<v MRS. BOXER>of the foreign reels

3120
01:53:03 --> 01:53:07
<v MRS. BOXER>reels

3121
01:53:07 --> 01:53:09
<v MRS. BOXER>foreign relation

3122
01:53:09 --> 01:53:12
<v MRS. BOXER>committee that when we have such

3123
01:53:12 --> 01:53:14
<v MRS. BOXER>delicate negotiations going on

3124
01:53:14 --> 01:53:16
<v MRS. BOXER>over our citizens that are being

3125
01:53:16 --> 01:53:19
<v MRS. BOXER>held there, we have to be very

3126
01:53:19 --> 01:53:21
<v MRS. BOXER>important not to interfere in

3127
01:53:21 --> 01:53:22
<v MRS. BOXER>that important backdoor

3128
01:53:22 --> 01:53:24
<v MRS. BOXER>diplomats that's going on.

3129
01:53:24 --> 01:53:26
<v MRS. BOXER>But we have one senator has

3130
01:53:26 --> 01:53:28
<v MRS. BOXER>holding up everything, because

3131
01:53:28 --> 01:53:31
<v MRS. BOXER>he insists that we have to make

3132
01:53:31 --> 01:53:32
<v MRS. BOXER>-- take a stand on egypt, even

3133
01:53:32 --> 01:53:36
<v MRS. BOXER>though we have americans in

3134
01:53:36 --> 01:53:37
<v MRS. BOXER>danger over there.

3135
01:53:37 --> 01:53:39
<v MRS. BOXER>My republican friends really

3136
01:53:39 --> 01:53:40
<v MRS. BOXER>have to understand what's at

3137
01:53:40 --> 01:53:42
<v MRS. BOXER>stake here.

3138
01:53:42 --> 01:53:45
<v MRS. BOXER>The business community, the

3139
01:53:45 --> 01:53:46
<v MRS. BOXER>labor community, everyone is in

3140
01:53:46 --> 01:53:46
<v MRS. BOXER>favor of this transportation

3141
01:53:46 --> 01:53:48
<v MRS. BOXER>bill.

3142
01:53:48 --> 01:53:52
<v MRS. BOXER>And we're going to have to face

3143
01:53:52 --> 01:53:55
<v MRS. BOXER>votes that are unrelated.

3144
01:53:55 --> 01:53:56
<v MRS. BOXER>There's an idea to repeal a very

3145
01:53:56 --> 01:53:58
<v MRS. BOXER>important environmental

3146
01:53:58 --> 01:54:00
<v MRS. BOXER>regulation that will clean up

3147
01:54:00 --> 01:54:03
<v MRS. BOXER>the pollution from boilers,

3148
01:54:03 --> 01:54:04
<v MRS. BOXER>pollution that is dangerous.

3149
01:54:04 --> 01:54:06
<v MRS. BOXER>It's mercury.

3150
01:54:06 --> 01:54:10
<v MRS. BOXER>it causes brain damage.

3151
01:54:10 --> 01:54:13
<v MRS. BOXER>It's arsenic -- it's lead.

3152
01:54:13 --> 01:54:13
<v MRS. BOXER>And, as I said yesterday -- and,

3153
01:54:13 --> 01:54:16
<v MRS. BOXER>Mr. President, I don't know

3154
01:54:16 --> 01:54:17
<v MRS. BOXER>whether you've had this

3155
01:54:17 --> 01:54:22
<v MRS. BOXER>experience -- I have never in

3156
01:54:22 --> 01:54:26
<v MRS. BOXER>the history of my career

3157
01:54:26 --> 01:54:27
<v MRS. BOXER>electoral

3158
01:54:27 --> 01:54:29
<v MRS. BOXER>career had anyone come up to me

3159
01:54:29 --> 01:54:31
<v MRS. BOXER>and said, please, please

3160
01:54:31 --> 01:54:37
<v MRS. BOXER>barbara, we really need more

3161
01:54:37 --> 01:54:39
<v MRS. BOXER>arsenic in our air, more mercury

3162
01:54:39 --> 01:54:42
<v MRS. BOXER>in more lead.

3163
01:54:42 --> 01:54:44
<v MRS. BOXER>Why would we repeal a very

3164
01:54:44 --> 01:54:45
<v MRS. BOXER>important rule that will make

3165
01:54:45 --> 01:54:46
<v MRS. BOXER>our families healthier?

3166
01:54:46 --> 01:54:47
<v MRS. BOXER>that's what my republican

3167
01:54:47 --> 01:54:49
<v MRS. BOXER>friends are putting out there.

3168
01:54:49 --> 01:54:51
<v MRS. BOXER>They want to drill off our

3169
01:54:51 --> 01:54:53
<v MRS. BOXER>coast, even though it might

3170
01:54:53 --> 01:54:55
<v MRS. BOXER>interfere with the fishing

3171
01:54:55 --> 01:55:00
<v MRS. BOXER>industry, the tourist industry,

3172
01:55:00 --> 01:55:03
<v MRS. BOXER>the recreation industry.

3173
01:55:03 --> 01:55:06
<v MRS. BOXER>I just would urge my colleagues

3174
01:55:06 --> 01:55:08
<v MRS. BOXER>in a hand of friendship, we are

3175
01:55:08 --> 01:55:09
<v MRS. BOXER>happy to look at

3176
01:55:09 --> 01:55:09
<v MRS. BOXER>transportation-related

3177
01:55:09 --> 01:55:11
<v MRS. BOXER>amendments.

3178
01:55:11 --> 01:55:13
<v MRS. BOXER>We can work those through.

3179
01:55:13 --> 01:55:16
<v MRS. BOXER>My staff and senator inhofe's

3180
01:55:16 --> 01:55:17
<v MRS. BOXER>staff are very -- have a very

3181
01:55:17 --> 01:55:19
<v MRS. BOXER>close working relationship, and

3182
01:55:19 --> 01:55:21
<v MRS. BOXER>we can take these relevant

3183
01:55:21 --> 01:55:23
<v MRS. BOXER>amendments and sit down and work

3184
01:55:23 --> 01:55:26
<v MRS. BOXER>through them.

3185
01:55:26 --> 01:55:27
<v MRS. BOXER>but, obviously, if there are

3186
01:55:27 --> 01:55:29
<v MRS. BOXER>going to be a series of

3187
01:55:29 --> 01:55:31
<v MRS. BOXER>amendments on birth control and

3188
01:55:31 --> 01:55:33
<v MRS. BOXER>foreign policy matters and

3189
01:55:33 --> 01:55:35
<v MRS. BOXER>extraneous matters, it makes it

3190
01:55:35 --> 01:55:37
<v MRS. BOXER>very, very difficult.

3191
01:55:37 --> 01:55:39
<v MRS. BOXER>It diverts our attention from

3192
01:55:39 --> 01:55:42
<v MRS. BOXER>what's at stake.

3193
01:55:42 --> 01:55:43
<v MRS. BOXER>The clock is ticking on us.

3194
01:55:43 --> 01:55:45
<v MRS. BOXER>This transportation

3195
01:55:45 --> 01:55:48
<v MRS. BOXER>authorization that we have

3196
01:55:48 --> 01:55:50
<v MRS. BOXER>expires in March.

3197
01:55:50 --> 01:55:52
<v MRS. BOXER>So here's where wemplet we are

3198
01:55:52 --> 01:55:55
<v MRS. BOXER>going to have a cloture vote on

3199
01:55:55 --> 01:55:58
<v MRS. BOXER>the various titles to the bill:

3200
01:55:58 --> 01:56:00
<v MRS. BOXER>the finance title, the banking

3201
01:56:00 --> 01:56:00
<v MRS. BOXER>title, the commerce committee

3202
01:56:00 --> 01:56:03
<v MRS. BOXER>title.

3203
01:56:03 --> 01:56:03
<v MRS. BOXER>And I want to praise all of the

3204
01:56:03 --> 01:56:04
<v MRS. BOXER>committees.

3205
01:56:04 --> 01:56:05
<v MRS. BOXER>They've done their work.

3206
01:56:05 --> 01:56:09
<v MRS. BOXER>Four committees, including ours,

3207
01:56:09 --> 01:56:10
<v MRS. BOXER>the E.P.W., environment and

3208
01:56:10 --> 01:56:12
<v MRS. BOXER>public works, committee.

3209
01:56:12 --> 01:56:13
<v MRS. BOXER>We've all done our jobs.

3210
01:56:13 --> 01:56:15
<v MRS. BOXER>We did what we had to do.

3211
01:56:15 --> 01:56:16
<v MRS. BOXER>We passed out the legislation.

3212
01:56:16 --> 01:56:20
<v MRS. BOXER>Now let's mary

3213
01:56:20 --> 01:56:21
<v MRS. BOXER>marry all the pieces

3214
01:56:21 --> 01:56:25
<v MRS. BOXER>and get this done.

3215
01:56:25 --> 01:56:27
<v MRS. BOXER>Get this done.

3216
01:56:27 --> 01:56:29
<v MRS. BOXER>and -- so I urge colleagues to

3217
01:56:29 --> 01:56:31
<v MRS. BOXER>vote &quot;yes&quot; on cloture.

3218
01:56:31 --> 01:56:36
<v MRS. BOXER>I know some have problems with

3219
01:56:36 --> 01:56:37
<v MRS. BOXER>one of the titles, and we can

3220
01:56:37 --> 01:56:38
<v MRS. BOXER>amend that.

3221
01:56:38 --> 01:56:41
<v MRS. BOXER>If you don't like something in

3222
01:56:41 --> 01:56:44
<v MRS. BOXER>that title, we can amend it.

3223
01:56:44 --> 01:56:47
<v MRS. BOXER>And if we don't make cloture on

3224
01:56:47 --> 01:56:49
<v MRS. BOXER>the first round, welcome up with

3225
01:56:49 --> 01:56:51
<v MRS. BOXER>a path forward after that.

3226
01:56:51 --> 01:56:55
<v MRS. BOXER>But, please, it won't work if we

3227
01:56:55 --> 01:56:56
<v MRS. BOXER>have all of these bizarre,

3228
01:56:56 --> 01:56:59
<v MRS. BOXER>extraneous amendments.

3229
01:56:59 --> 01:57:01
<v MRS. BOXER>I'm not saying the amendments

3230
01:57:01 --> 01:57:02
<v MRS. BOXER>are bizarre -- some are -- but

3231
01:57:02 --> 01:57:06
<v MRS. BOXER>they're extraneous.

3232
01:57:06 --> 01:57:07
<v MRS. BOXER>And they don't belong on this

3233
01:57:07 --> 01:57:10
<v MRS. BOXER>bill.

3234
01:57:10 --> 01:57:13
<v MRS. BOXER>now, I want to take a minute to

3235
01:57:13 --> 01:57:15
<v MRS. BOXER>remind my colleagues how popular

3236
01:57:15 --> 01:57:18
<v MRS. BOXER>the transportation authorization

3237
01:57:18 --> 01:57:21
<v MRS. BOXER>is.

3238
01:57:21 --> 01:57:23
<v MRS. BOXER>President Reagan -- do we have

3239
01:57:23 --> 01:57:25
<v MRS. BOXER>that ad?

3240
01:57:25 --> 01:57:26
<v MRS. BOXER>We're going to show you the ad

3241
01:57:26 --> 01:57:27
<v MRS. BOXER>that's being run.

3242
01:57:27 --> 01:57:31
<v MRS. BOXER>But President Reagan was very

3243
01:57:31 --> 01:57:33
<v MRS. BOXER>clear on why it was so important

3244
01:57:33 --> 01:57:35
<v MRS. BOXER>to pass a transportation bill.

3245
01:57:35 --> 01:57:37
<v MRS. BOXER>Here's what he said.

3246
01:57:37 --> 01:57:40
<v MRS. BOXER>&quot;the state of our transportation

3247
01:57:40 --> 01:57:44
<v MRS. BOXER>system affects our commerce, our

3248
01:57:44 --> 01:57:46
<v MRS. BOXER>economy, and our future.&quot;

3249
01:57:46 --> 01:57:48
<v MRS. BOXER>he said, &quot;clearly, this program

3250
01:57:48 --> 01:57:54
<v MRS. BOXER>is an investment in tomorrow

3251
01:57:54 --> 01:57:56
<v MRS. BOXER>that we must make today.&quot;

3252
01:57:56 --> 01:57:59
<v MRS. BOXER>and there is a very good

3253
01:57:59 --> 01:58:01
<v MRS. BOXER>coalition out there, broad

3254
01:58:01 --> 01:58:02
<v MRS. BOXER>coalition, taking ads on the

3255
01:58:02 --> 01:58:05
<v MRS. BOXER>radio, and after they quote

3256
01:58:05 --> 01:58:07
<v MRS. BOXER>ronald reagan, they say, &quot;it's

3257
01:58:07 --> 01:58:09
<v MRS. BOXER>time for leadership again, for

3258
01:58:09 --> 01:58:10
<v MRS. BOXER>new investments in

3259
01:58:10 --> 01:58:12
<v MRS. BOXER>transportation to keep america

3260
01:58:12 --> 01:58:13
<v MRS. BOXER>moving and jobs growing.

3261
01:58:13 --> 01:58:15
<v MRS. BOXER>Call congress.

3262
01:58:15 --> 01:58:17
<v MRS. BOXER>Tell them to pass the highway

3263
01:58:17 --> 01:58:20
<v MRS. BOXER>and transit bill and once again

<v MRS. BOXER>so, this is out on the radio

<v MRS. BOXER>airwaves.

3268
01:58:24 --> 01:58:28
<v MRS. BOXER>Irm

3269
01:58:28 --> 01:58:28
<v MRS. BOXER>I'm very grateful that it's

3270
01:58:28 --> 01:58:30
<v MRS. BOXER>happening.

3271
01:58:30 --> 01:58:32
<v MRS. BOXER>i really, really am.

3272
01:58:32 --> 01:58:34
<v MRS. BOXER>And also we have ads in the ver

<v MRS. BOXER>just newspapers -- in the

3274
01:58:35 --> 01:58:37
<v MRS. BOXER>various newspapers.

3275
01:58:37 --> 01:58:39
<v MRS. BOXER>Then there's another one that

3276
01:58:39 --> 01:58:40
<v MRS. BOXER>marries two presidents's

3277
01:58:40 --> 01:58:42
<v MRS. BOXER>statements, President Reagan and

<v MRS. BOXER>They quote President Clinton by

3280
01:58:45 --> 01:58:47
<v MRS. BOXER>saying, &quot;by modernizing and

3281
01:58:47 --> 01:58:50
<v MRS. BOXER>building roads, bridges,

3282

<v MRS. BOXER>unparallel growth.&quot;

3285
01:58:57 --> 01:58:58
<v MRS. BOXER>and then they also quote ronald

3286
01:58:58 --> 01:59:00
<v MRS. BOXER>reagan again.

3287
01:59:00 --> 01:59:02
<v MRS. BOXER>He says, &quot;a network of highways

3288
01:59:02 --> 01:59:03
<v MRS. BOXER>and mass transit has enabled our

3289
01:59:03 --> 01:59:06
<v MRS. BOXER>commerce to thrive.

3290
01:59:06 --> 01:59:09
<v MRS. BOXER>&quot; and at the end it says, &quot;tell

3291
01:59:09 --> 01:59:11
<v MRS. BOXER>congress to pass the highway and

3292
01:59:11 --> 01:59:14
<v MRS. BOXER>transit bill and make

01:59:14 --> 01:59:17
<v MRS. BOXER>transportation job number one.&quot;

3294
01:59:17 --> 01:59:18
<v MRS. BOXER>so here we sit -- and I wanted

3295
01:59:18 --> 01:59:20
<v MRS. BOXER>to show you.

3296
01:59:20 --> 01:59:20
<v MRS. BOXER>I don't know if people can see

3297
01:59:20 --> 01:59:22
<v MRS. BOXER>this.

3298
01:59:22 --> 01:59:23
<v MRS. BOXER>I hope you can see this,

3299
01:59:23 --> 01:59:24
<v MRS. BOXER>Mr. President.

3300
01:59:24 --> 01:59:27
<v MRS. BOXER>This is an ad that is running

3301
01:59:27 --> 01:59:28
<v MRS. BOXER>all over today.

3302
01:59:28 --> 01:59:29
<v MRS. BOXER>&quot;President Reagan stood up for

3303
01:59:29 --> 01:59:30
<v MRS. BOXER>public transportation.

3304
01:59:30 --> 01:59:33
<v MRS. BOXER>will you?&quot;

3305
01:59:33 --> 01:59:35
<v MRS. BOXER>and then they quote him, and

3306
01:59:35 --> 01:59:37
<v MRS. BOXER>then they say, &quot;a recovering

3307
01:59:37 --> 01:59:38
<v MRS. BOXER>economy is exactly the time to

3308
01:59:38 --> 01:59:41
<v MRS. BOXER>rebuild america.

3309
01:59:41 --> 01:59:43
<v MRS. BOXER>President Reagan knew it in 1983

3310
01:59:43 --> 01:59:46
<v MRS. BOXER>when he signed the law

3311
01:59:46 --> 01:59:47
<v MRS. BOXER>dedicating motor fuel ref revenues

3312
01:59:47 --> 01:59:48
<v MRS. BOXER>to public transportation for

3313
01:59:48 --> 01:59:49
<v MRS. BOXER>years 0 come.

3314
01:59:49 --> 01:59:51
<v MRS. BOXER>But now the house&quot; -- and they

3315
01:59:51 --> 01:59:52
<v MRS. BOXER>talk about the problem with the

3316
01:59:52 --> 01:59:53
<v MRS. BOXER>house bill and they tell the

3317
01:59:53 --> 01:59:54
<v MRS. BOXER>house to fix their proposal,

3318
01:59:54 --> 01:59:58
<v MRS. BOXER>which we hope that they are

3319
01:59:58 --> 02:00:00
<v MRS. BOXER>doing as we speak.

3320
02:00:00 --> 02:00:03
<v MRS. BOXER>So this is a very important

3321
02:00:03 --> 02:00:05
<v MRS. BOXER>endeavor.

3322
02:00:05 --> 02:00:06
<v MRS. BOXER>You know, again, I've been

3323

<v MRS. BOXER>Mr. President.

3325
02:00:11 --> 02:00:12
<v MRS. BOXER>i have never seen a coalition --

3326
02:00:12 --> 02:00:12
<v MRS. BOXER>the likes of the coalition we

3327
02:00:12 --> 02:00:14
<v MRS. BOXER>have seen.

3328
02:00:14 --> 02:00:16
<v MRS. BOXER>Can you show the chart that

3329
02:00:16 --> 02:00:24
<v MRS. BOXER>shows over the 1,000

3330
02:00:24 --> 02:00:27
<v MRS. BOXER>organizations.

3331
02:00:27 --> 02:00:28
<v MRS. BOXER>We have a coalition,

3332
02:00:28 --> 02:00:31
<v MRS. BOXER>Mr. President, the broadest

3333
02:00:31 --> 02:00:32
<v MRS. BOXER>coalition I have ever seen in my

<v MRS. BOXER>or kentucky -- I am tell you,

3338
02:00:43 --> 02:00:44
<v MRS. BOXER>this is a strong coalition.

3339
02:00:44 --> 02:00:45
<v MRS. BOXER>And this is what they wrote to

3340
02:00:45 --> 02:00:48

3341
02:00:48 --> 02:00:49

<v MRS. BOXER>for the job creation and

3420
02:03:21 --> 02:03:23

3421
02:03:23 --> 02:03:24
<v MRS. BOXER>single senator in this chamber

3422
02:03:24 --> 02:03:26

<v MRS. BOXER>stake in their states.

3424
02:03:29 --> 02:03:30
<v MRS. BOXER>In closing, I will say this:

3425
02:03:30 --> 02:03:33
<v MRS. BOXER>Madam President, sometimes when

3426
02:03:33 --> 02:03:36
<v MRS. BOXER>we act, we not only do something

3427
02:03:36 --> 02:03:38
<v MRS. BOXER>good, which this bill will do --

3428
02:03:38 --> 02:03:40
<v MRS. BOXER>it's a reform bill.

3429
02:03:40 --> 02:03:42
<v MRS. BOXER>It's a great bill, and it adds

3430
02:03:42 --> 02:03:44
<v MRS. BOXER>to the tifia program, an idea

3431
02:03:44 --> 02:03:46
<v MRS. BOXER>that came out of los angeles and

3432
02:03:46 --> 02:03:48
<v MRS. BOXER>is going to create up to a

3433
02:03:48 --> 02:03:50
<v MRS. BOXER>million new jobs while

3434
02:03:50 --> 02:03:52
<v MRS. BOXER>protecting 1.8 million jobs.

3435
02:03:52 --> 02:03:54
<v MRS. BOXER>So we do good things.

3436
02:03:54 --> 02:03:56
<v MRS. BOXER>But we also, Madam President,

3437
02:03:56 --> 02:03:57
<v MRS. BOXER>when we do this, we stop bad

3438
02:03:57 --> 02:03:59
<v MRS. BOXER>things from happening.

3439
02:03:59 --> 02:04:02
<v MRS. BOXER>What will happen if we fail to

3440
02:04:02 --> 02:04:03
<v MRS. BOXER>act by March 30 and there is no

3441
02:04:03 --> 02:04:07
<v MRS. BOXER>action fill that trust fund,

3442
02:04:07 --> 02:04:08
<v MRS. BOXER>which our bill does?

3443
02:04:08 --> 02:04:11
<v MRS. BOXER>600,000 jobs will be lost.

3444
02:04:11 --> 02:04:13
<v MRS. BOXER>And later today at a time when

3445
02:04:13 --> 02:04:17
<v MRS. BOXER>others are not here, I will go

3446
02:04:17 --> 02:04:18
<v MRS. BOXER>state by state -- here it is.

3447
02:04:18 --> 02:04:21
<v MRS. BOXER>Estimated jobs lost.

3448
02:04:21 --> 02:04:22
<v MRS. BOXER>There would be a 35% cut in

3449
02:04:22 --> 02:04:24
<v MRS. BOXER>transportation funding if we

3450
02:04:24 --> 02:04:26
<v MRS. BOXER>don't pass this bill.

3451
02:04:26 --> 02:04:27
<v MRS. BOXER>And the finance title that

3452
02:04:27 --> 02:04:29
<v MRS. BOXER>raises the funds necessary.

3453
02:04:29 --> 02:04:32
<v MRS. BOXER>We will break this down.

3454
02:04:32 --> 02:04:34
<v MRS. BOXER>And let me tell you, it's an

3455
02:04:34 --> 02:04:35
<v MRS. BOXER>ugly picture for us to have to

3456
02:04:35 --> 02:04:37
<v MRS. BOXER>go home and face the music at

3457
02:04:37 --> 02:04:42
<v MRS. BOXER>home and tell construction

3458
02:04:42 --> 02:04:44
<v MRS. BOXER>workers that even though we have

3459
02:04:44 --> 02:04:45
<v MRS. BOXER>1.5 million unemployed

3460
02:04:45 --> 02:04:48
<v MRS. BOXER>construction workers, that's

3461
02:04:48 --> 02:04:50
<v MRS. BOXER>going to go up by 600,000 jobs.

3462
02:04:50 --> 02:04:51
<v MRS. BOXER>We cannot afford to let this

3463
02:04:51 --> 02:04:53
<v MRS. BOXER>bill stop.

3464
02:04:53 --> 02:04:53
<v MRS. BOXER>I will not let this bill go

3465
02:04:53 --> 02:04:55
<v MRS. BOXER>away.

3466
02:04:55 --> 02:04:57
<v MRS. BOXER>I will assert every right I have

3467
02:04:57 --> 02:04:59
<v MRS. BOXER>as a U.S. Senator from

3468
02:04:59 --> 02:05:01
<v MRS. BOXER>california where we have 63,000

3469
02:05:01 --> 02:05:03
<v MRS. BOXER>of these jobs at stake.

3470
02:05:03 --> 02:05:04
<v MRS. BOXER>And I'm going to be here on the

3471
02:05:04 --> 02:05:06
<v MRS. BOXER>floor, and we're going to get

3472
02:05:06 --> 02:05:07
<v MRS. BOXER>this bill done one way or

3473
02:05:07 --> 02:05:08
<v MRS. BOXER>another.

3474
02:05:08 --> 02:05:12
<v MRS. BOXER>And we stand ready to work with

3475
02:05:12 --> 02:05:13
<v MRS. BOXER>our colleagues to work with our

3476
02:05:13 --> 02:05:14
<v MRS. BOXER>republican friends, to go

3477
02:05:14 --> 02:05:17
<v MRS. BOXER>through these amendments that

3478
02:05:17 --> 02:05:20
<v MRS. BOXER>are relevant and urge them to

3479
02:05:20 --> 02:05:21
<v MRS. BOXER>backtrack on these very

3480
02:05:21 --> 02:05:23
<v MRS. BOXER>unrelated amendments.

3481
02:05:23 --> 02:05:28
<v MRS. BOXER>And I thank you so much, and I

3482
02:05:28 --> 02:05:29
<v MRS. BOXER>would yield the floor.

3483
02:05:28 --> 02:05:30
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

3484
02:05:30 --> 02:05:31
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senator from california.

3485
02:05:33 --> 02:05:34
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Madam President, I want to thank

3486
02:05:34 --> 02:05:35
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>my friend and colleague, the

3487

<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>distinguished Chairman Of the

3488
02:05:37 --> 02:05:38
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>committee, for her work in

3489
02:05:38 --> 02:05:39
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>managing this bill.

3490
02:05:39 --> 02:05:41
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>this is a huge bill.

3491
02:05:41 --> 02:05:43
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>It's got many titles.

3492
02:05:43 --> 02:05:46
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>It's a complex bill.

3493
02:05:46 --> 02:05:48
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>It is a totally vital bill.

3494
02:05:48 --> 02:05:51
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Both on this floor and off this

3495
02:05:51 --> 02:05:52
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>floor, she has been advocating

3496
02:05:52 --> 02:05:53
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>and pushing and doing what's

3497
02:05:53 --> 02:05:55
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>necessary.

3498
02:05:55 --> 02:05:58
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>I just want to say thank you

3499
02:05:58 --> 02:05:59
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>very, very much, my friend and

<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>colleague, senator boxer.

<v MRS. BOXER>thank you.

3502
02:06:01 --> 02:06:02
<v MRS. BOXER>And we're working it.

3503
02:06:02 --> 02:06:05
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>thank you.

3504
02:06:05 --> 02:06:08
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Let me describe what happened in

3505
02:06:08 --> 02:06:12
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>2008 in chatsworth, california.

3506
02:06:12 --> 02:06:17
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>On September 12, 2008, metrolink

3507
02:06:17 --> 02:06:20
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>commuter train carrying 111

3508
02:06:20 --> 02:06:23
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>more -- train 111 carrying more

3509
02:06:23 --> 02:06:27
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>than 200 people departed the

3510
02:06:27 --> 02:06:27
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>chatworth train station about

3511
02:06:27 --> 02:06:28
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>4:20 P.M.

3512
02:06:28 --> 02:06:31
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Heading west, the commuter train

3513
02:06:31 --> 02:06:38
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>ran through a train signal at 44

3514
02:06:38 --> 02:06:40
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>miles per hour at 4:22.02.

3515
02:06:40 --> 02:06:42
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>the train signal showed red for

3516
02:06:42 --> 02:06:42
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>stofplt at the same time a --

3517
02:06:42 --> 02:06:45
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>for stop.

3518
02:06:45 --> 02:06:48
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>At the same time a union pacific

3519
02:06:48 --> 02:06:50
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>freight train weighing four

3520
02:06:50 --> 02:06:51
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>times the weight was heading

3521
02:06:51 --> 02:06:54
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>east on the same track.

3522
02:06:54 --> 02:06:58
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>It exited the tunnel with little

3523
02:06:58 --> 02:06:59
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>time to react to the on coming

3524
02:06:59 --> 02:07:00
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>commuter train.

3525
02:07:00 --> 02:07:02
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>both trains were on the same

3526
02:07:02 --> 02:07:04
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>track going in opposite

3527
02:07:04 --> 02:07:07
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>directions, each going roughly

3528
02:07:07 --> 02:07:08
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>40 miles per hour, the trains

3529
02:07:08 --> 02:07:10
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>collided head on.

3530
02:07:10 --> 02:07:12
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>The carnage was unspeakable.

3531
02:07:12 --> 02:07:15
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>25 people died.

3532
02:07:15 --> 02:07:19
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Their bodies, many torn to

3533
02:07:19 --> 02:07:21
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>pieces, had to be extracted from

3534
02:07:21 --> 02:07:23
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>heaps of steel and wreckage.

3535
02:07:23 --> 02:07:26
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>This is the scene.

3536
02:07:26 --> 02:07:29
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>This is the commuter train.

3537
02:07:29 --> 02:07:34
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>This is the freight train.

3538
02:07:34 --> 02:07:40
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>This is the car that essentially

3539
02:07:40 --> 02:07:45
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>chopped apart 25 people.

3540
02:07:45 --> 02:07:46
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>A superior judge peter lichtman

3541
02:07:46 --> 02:07:48
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>wrote there were teachers,

3542
02:07:48 --> 02:07:50
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>federal, state, municipal

3543
02:07:50 --> 02:07:51
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>employees, business owners,

3544
02:07:51 --> 02:07:53
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>executives, artists and students

3545
02:07:53 --> 02:07:55
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>that were all lost on that day.

3546
02:07:55 --> 02:07:57
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Many families were left without

3547
02:07:58 --> 02:08:01
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>any provider, not to mention the

3548
02:08:01 --> 02:08:04
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>loss of a mother or father.

3549
02:08:04 --> 02:08:06
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Another 101 people were injured,

3550
02:08:06 --> 02:08:09
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>many of them very seriously.

3551
02:08:09 --> 02:08:10
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Volunteers and rescue crews

3552
02:08:10 --> 02:08:12
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>worked valiantly to pull them

3553
02:08:12 --> 02:08:14
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>from the wreckage.

3554
02:08:14 --> 02:08:15
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>You can see this overturned

3555
02:08:15 --> 02:08:19
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>train here.

3556
02:08:19 --> 02:08:21
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>You see the rescue crews.

3557
02:08:21 --> 02:08:24
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>it was just -- it was a

3558
02:08:24 --> 02:08:26
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>terrible, terrible scene.

3559
02:08:26 --> 02:08:29
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Judge peter lichtman described

3560
02:08:29 --> 02:08:31
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>many of these injuries.

3561
02:08:31 --> 02:08:33
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Passengers seated at table seats

3562
02:08:33 --> 02:08:35
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>suffered horrible abdominal

3563
02:08:35 --> 02:08:36
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>injuries that could not be

3564
02:08:37 --> 02:08:39
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>medically resolved.

3565
02:08:39 --> 02:08:41
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>All of the bench passengers were

3566
02:08:41 --> 02:08:42
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>launched head or face first into

3567
02:08:42 --> 02:08:44
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>a bulk head.

3568
02:08:44 --> 02:08:46
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Almost all of these passengers

3569
02:08:46 --> 02:08:48
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>suffered traumatic brain

3570
02:08:48 --> 02:08:52
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>injuries to varying degrees.

3571
02:08:52 --> 02:08:52
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Let me explain how and why this

3572
02:08:52 --> 02:08:55
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>happened.

3573
02:08:55 --> 02:08:57
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Seconds before the crash, the

3574
02:08:57 --> 02:08:59
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>train's engineer was text

3575
02:08:59 --> 02:09:03
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>messaging on his cell phone.

3576
02:09:03 --> 02:09:04
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>he was the only person, only

3577
02:09:04 --> 02:09:06
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>personnel aboard that train.

3578
02:09:06 --> 02:09:10
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>When he looked down to send the

3579
02:09:10 --> 02:09:13
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>text to a teenage boy.

3580
02:09:13 --> 02:09:16
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>This was one of 21 text messages

3581
02:09:16 --> 02:09:19
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>sent by this engineer this day.

3582
02:09:19 --> 02:09:21
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>He received 20 text messages and

3583
02:09:21 --> 02:09:24
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>made four outgoing telephone

3584
02:09:24 --> 02:09:25
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>calls all while he was driving a

3585
02:09:25 --> 02:09:30
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>large commuter train.

3586
02:09:30 --> 02:09:31
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>According to the ntsb,

3587
02:09:31 --> 02:09:33
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>comprehensive report on the

3588
02:09:33 --> 02:09:35
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>crash, this behavior distracted

3589
02:09:35 --> 02:09:36
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>the engineer and caused the

3590
02:09:36 --> 02:09:40
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>collision.

3591
02:09:40 --> 02:09:40
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>It led to the train running red

3592
02:09:40 --> 02:09:43
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>signals.

3593
02:09:43 --> 02:09:45
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>in fact, ntsb found the

3594
02:09:45 --> 02:09:48
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>passenger train's engineer never

3595
02:09:48 --> 02:09:50
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>even hit the brakes before

3596
02:09:50 --> 02:09:52
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>impact.

3597
02:09:52 --> 02:09:53
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Ntsb found that a crash

3598
02:09:53 --> 02:09:57
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>avoidance system would have

3599
02:09:57 --> 02:09:59
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>stopped the train and prevented

3600
02:09:59 --> 02:10:01
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>this disaster.

3601
02:10:01 --> 02:10:05
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>But unfortunately, the tracks in

3602
02:10:05 --> 02:10:05
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>los angeles had and have no such

3603
02:10:05 --> 02:10:08
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>systems.

3604
02:10:08 --> 02:10:08
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Nor do most tracks in the united

3605
02:10:08 --> 02:10:12
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>states.

3606
02:10:12 --> 02:10:16
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>As a result of this accident, 25

3607
02:10:16 --> 02:10:17
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>people died and 100 people were

3608
02:10:17 --> 02:10:18
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>injured.

3609
02:10:19 --> 02:10:20
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>The statistics about the

3610
02:10:20 --> 02:10:22
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>chatworth disaster do not begin

3611
02:10:22 --> 02:10:23
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>to tell the story.

3612
02:10:23 --> 02:10:25
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>perhaps I might be able to

3613
02:10:25 --> 02:10:28
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>better put into words what's at

3614
02:10:28 --> 02:10:31
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>stake in this debate in one of

3615
02:10:31 --> 02:10:34
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>the votes we will be taking

3616
02:10:34 --> 02:10:37
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>about positive train control by

3617
02:10:37 --> 02:10:42
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>telling you a little bit about

3618
02:10:42 --> 02:10:44
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>kerry shea and atule vias.

3619
02:10:44 --> 02:10:46
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>18-year-old kerry didn't want to

3620
02:10:46 --> 02:10:48
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>trouble her father to drive her

3621
02:10:48 --> 02:10:50
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>from her family's home to the

3622
02:10:50 --> 02:10:51
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>restaurant in simi valley so she

3623
02:10:51 --> 02:10:54
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>took the train.

3624
02:10:54 --> 02:10:57
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>In October 2008, she became one

3625
02:10:57 --> 02:10:58
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>of many young people killed in

3626
02:10:58 --> 02:11:00
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>this crash.

3627
02:11:00 --> 02:11:02
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>She was just starting her senior

3628
02:11:02 --> 02:11:04
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>year at hart high school and

3629
02:11:04 --> 02:11:06
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>looking forward to a career in

3630
02:11:06 --> 02:11:06
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>medicine, according to her

3631
02:11:06 --> 02:11:08
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>family.

3632
02:11:08 --> 02:11:11
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>She played tennis for the school

3633
02:11:11 --> 02:11:12
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>and was well liked by her

3634
02:11:12 --> 02:11:15
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>classmates with who described

3635
02:11:15 --> 02:11:17
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>her as warm and caring.

3636
02:11:17 --> 02:11:20
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Anyone who knew her can remember

3637
02:11:20 --> 02:11:22
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>her by her beaming smile and

3638
02:11:22 --> 02:11:27
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>infectious laugh, one of her

3639
02:11:27 --> 02:11:28
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>classmates told &quot;&quot;the los

3640
02:11:28 --> 02:11:29
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>angeles times&quot;.&quot;

3641
02:11:29 --> 02:11:30
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>and here she is.

3642
02:11:31 --> 02:11:33
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>She had such a positive outlook

3643
02:11:33 --> 02:11:37
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>on life and always had something

3644
02:11:37 --> 02:11:38
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>nice to say about everyone wrote

3645
02:11:38 --> 02:11:40
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>a parent.

3646
02:11:40 --> 02:11:42
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>I feel blessed to have been part

3647
02:11:42 --> 02:11:46
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>of her life.

3648
02:11:46 --> 02:11:50
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>then there is atol vias, a

3649
02:11:50 --> 02:11:53
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>student at clairmont Mckenna

3650
02:11:53 --> 02:11:53
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>college studying to become a

3651
02:11:53 --> 02:11:55
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>doctor.

3652
02:11:55 --> 02:11:57
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>At 20 years old he was

3653
02:11:57 --> 02:11:59
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>processing to graduate programs

3654
02:11:59 --> 02:12:01
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>at M.I.T., duke and harvard.

3655
02:12:01 --> 02:12:03
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>He scored in the top 1% of his

3656
02:12:03 --> 02:12:05
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>medical school entry exams, but

3657
02:12:05 --> 02:12:08
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>he was having trouble answering

3658
02:12:08 --> 02:12:10
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>one question on applications.

3659
02:12:10 --> 02:12:10
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Describe a hardship you've

3660
02:12:10 --> 02:12:13
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>overcome.

3661
02:12:13 --> 02:12:16
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>He said I've not had any.

3662
02:12:16 --> 02:12:19
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>I've had a blessed life,

3663
02:12:19 --> 02:12:21
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>explained his father.

3664
02:12:21 --> 02:12:23
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Atole never finished that

3665
02:12:23 --> 02:12:25
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>application nor did he reach his

3666
02:12:25 --> 02:12:27
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>goal of medical school.

3667
02:12:27 --> 02:12:29
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>He took metro link train 111

3668
02:12:29 --> 02:12:31
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>home to visit his family as he

3669
02:12:31 --> 02:12:33
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>did every two to three weeks,

3670
02:12:33 --> 02:12:35
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>but he never made it home

3671
02:12:35 --> 02:12:38
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>because an engineer was texting.

3672
02:12:38 --> 02:12:41
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>As the ntsb found, these young

3673
02:12:41 --> 02:12:46
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>lives and the lives of 23 others

3674
02:12:46 --> 02:12:46
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>could have been saved if

3675
02:12:46 --> 02:12:49
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>crash-avoidance technology,

3676
02:12:49 --> 02:12:53
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>known as positive train control,

3677
02:12:53 --> 02:12:56
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>had been in place.

3678
02:12:56 --> 02:12:58
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>In 2008, congress finally

3679
02:12:58 --> 02:13:00
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>required railroads to deploy

3680
02:13:00 --> 02:13:03
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>positive train control, which

3681
02:13:03 --> 02:13:06
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>the national transportation

3682
02:13:07 --> 02:13:09
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>safety board had placed on its

3683
02:13:09 --> 02:13:12
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>top-ten most wanted safety

3684
02:13:12 --> 02:13:15
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>technologies listed since 1990.

3685
02:13:15 --> 02:13:18
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>This body gave -- this body gave

3686
02:13:18 --> 02:13:21
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>the railroad industry seven

3687
02:13:21 --> 02:13:24
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>years to deploy positive train

3688
02:13:24 --> 02:13:25
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>control crash-avoidance systems

3689
02:13:25 --> 02:13:27
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>nationwide.

3690
02:13:27 --> 02:13:30
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>the leaders of southern

3691
02:13:30 --> 02:13:33
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>california metro link, union

3692
02:13:33 --> 02:13:36
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>pacific and bnsf railroads each

3693
02:13:36 --> 02:13:39
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>committed to deploy positive

3694
02:13:39 --> 02:13:40
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>train control systems in los

3695
02:13:40 --> 02:13:42
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>angeles years earlier than the

3696
02:13:42 --> 02:13:44
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>national mandate.

3697
02:13:44 --> 02:13:47
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>These railroads are still on

3698
02:13:47 --> 02:13:47
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>track to deploy the system next

3699
02:13:47 --> 02:13:51
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>year.

3700
02:13:51 --> 02:13:54
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>I met yesterday with john tpepb

3701
02:13:54 --> 02:13:57
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>ton, the new -- fenton, new

3702
02:13:57 --> 02:14:00
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>C.E.O. Of metro link and matt

3703
02:14:00 --> 02:14:01
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>chase, the C.E.O. Of bnsf.

3704
02:14:01 --> 02:14:05
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>They both indicated their desire

3705
02:14:05 --> 02:14:07
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>to make the highest priority

3706
02:14:07 --> 02:14:09
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>positive train control.

3707
02:14:09 --> 02:14:11
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>And I really thank them.

3708
02:14:11 --> 02:14:12
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>The metro link is going to go

3709
02:14:12 --> 02:14:14
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>ahead with it as soon as

3710
02:14:14 --> 02:14:17
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>possible regardless.

3711
02:14:17 --> 02:14:19
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Bnsf told us, well, if they

3712
02:14:19 --> 02:14:21
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>delay -- if this bill delays it,

3713
02:14:21 --> 02:14:21
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>they May take an additional

3714
02:14:21 --> 02:14:25
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>year.

3715
02:14:25 --> 02:14:28
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>I really salute both of them for

3716
02:14:28 --> 02:14:30
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>their support of this program.

3717
02:14:30 --> 02:14:32
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>However, I'm very alarmed that

3718
02:14:32 --> 02:14:35
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>others in the railroad industry

3719
02:14:35 --> 02:14:38
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>and in congress diminish the

3720
02:14:38 --> 02:14:41
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>value of positive train control.

3721
02:14:41 --> 02:14:44
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>As a matter of fact, the bill

3722
02:14:44 --> 02:14:47
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>that we will most likely be

3723
02:14:47 --> 02:14:49
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>voting on as one of its title,

3724
02:14:49 --> 02:14:53
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>the commerce title, delays

3725
02:14:53 --> 02:14:53
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>positive train control until

3726
02:14:53 --> 02:14:57
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>2015.

3727
02:14:57 --> 02:15:03
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>And the house bill delays it

3728
02:15:03 --> 02:15:05
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>until 2020.

3729
02:15:05 --> 02:15:08
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>That's -- when the technology is

3730
02:15:08 --> 02:15:12
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>there, despite its complications

3731
02:15:12 --> 02:15:14
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>of installation, when you have

3732
02:15:14 --> 02:15:17
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>high-risk lines, freight lines

3733
02:15:17 --> 02:15:19
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>and commuter lines, traveling in

3734
02:15:19 --> 02:15:24
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>opposite directions on the same

3735
02:15:24 --> 02:15:25
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>track, and when you have human

3736
02:15:25 --> 02:15:28
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>frailty -- in this case one

3737
02:15:28 --> 02:15:32
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>engineer aboard a commuter train

3738
02:15:32 --> 02:15:34
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>of a couple of hundred people

3739
02:15:34 --> 02:15:37
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>texting -- the only answer to

3740
02:15:37 --> 02:15:39
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>assure the safety to the

3741
02:15:39 --> 02:15:41
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>commuter trains of this nation

3742
02:15:41 --> 02:15:42
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>really, in my view, is positive

3743
02:15:42 --> 02:15:45
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>train control.

3744
02:15:45 --> 02:15:48
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>I view it as an emergency need.

3745
02:15:48 --> 02:15:50
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>the ntsb views it as an

3746
02:15:50 --> 02:15:53
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>emergency need.

3747
02:15:53 --> 02:15:55
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>According to them, scores of

3748
02:15:55 --> 02:15:57
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>deadly accidents across the

3749
02:15:57 --> 02:16:00
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>country since 1970 could have

3750
02:16:00 --> 02:16:02
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>been prevented if positive train

3751
02:16:02 --> 02:16:03
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>control in effect were

3752
02:16:03 --> 02:16:06
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>installed.

3753
02:16:06 --> 02:16:08
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>And I agree strongly with the

3754
02:16:09 --> 02:16:11
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>ntsb Chairman Debra herzman who

3755
02:16:11 --> 02:16:13
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>I happen to know, who recently

3756
02:16:13 --> 02:16:15
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>wrote to the congress this: &quot;the

3757
02:16:15 --> 02:16:17
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>ntsb will be disappointed if

3758
02:16:17 --> 02:16:20
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>installation of this vital

3759
02:16:20 --> 02:16:22
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>safety system to prevent

3760
02:16:22 --> 02:16:23
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>fatalities and injuries is

3761
02:16:23 --> 02:16:25
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>delayed.&quot;

3762
02:16:25 --> 02:16:29
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>end quote.

3763
02:16:29 --> 02:16:30
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>The need to extend the 2015

3764
02:16:30 --> 02:16:34
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>positive train control

3765
02:16:34 --> 02:16:35
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>deployment deadline has not been

3766
02:16:35 --> 02:16:37
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>demonstrated.

3767
02:16:37 --> 02:16:39
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>The senate commerce committee

3768
02:16:39 --> 02:16:42
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>has held no hearings on this

3769
02:16:42 --> 02:16:45
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>issue, no published reports

3770
02:16:45 --> 02:16:46
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>investigating this question have

3771
02:16:46 --> 02:16:51
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>recommended an extension,

3772
02:16:51 --> 02:16:54
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>according to the ntsb experts.

3773
02:16:54 --> 02:16:56
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Furthermore, every railroad has

3774
02:16:56 --> 02:17:01
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>submitted an approved plan to

3775
02:17:01 --> 02:17:04
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>meet the 2015 deadline to the

3776
02:17:04 --> 02:17:05
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>federal railroad administration.

3777
02:17:05 --> 02:17:07
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>And the administration is

3778
02:17:07 --> 02:17:11
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>preparing a report to congress

3779
02:17:11 --> 02:17:12
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>on positive train control,

3780
02:17:12 --> 02:17:14
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>deployment progress this year,

3781
02:17:14 --> 02:17:17
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>which should provide us guidance

3782
02:17:17 --> 02:17:18
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>on that effort to date.

3783
02:17:18 --> 02:17:21
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>I think congress should consider

3784
02:17:21 --> 02:17:24
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>the F.R.A.'s findings carefully

3785
02:17:24 --> 02:17:27
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>before scaling back or delaying

3786
02:17:27 --> 02:17:30
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>a system that can prevent

3787
02:17:30 --> 02:17:32
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>crashes like chatsworth.

3788
02:17:32 --> 02:17:34
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>and there have been three prior

3789
02:17:34 --> 02:17:36
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>crashes that have taken lives on

3790
02:17:36 --> 02:17:39
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>this metro's link system.

3791
02:17:39 --> 02:17:40
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>These are not isolated things.

3792
02:17:40 --> 02:17:41
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>They happen.

3793
02:17:41 --> 02:17:44
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>And we now have a technical

3794
02:17:44 --> 02:17:46
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>system that can be 100% proof

3795
02:17:46 --> 02:17:48
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>positive to provide safety.

3796
02:17:48 --> 02:17:52
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>So I'm very concerned that

3797
02:17:52 --> 02:17:53
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>without a national strategy,

3798
02:17:53 --> 02:17:57
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>deployment of positive train

3799
02:17:57 --> 02:17:58
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>control in southern california

3800
02:17:58 --> 02:18:01
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>will become more difficult.

3801
02:18:01 --> 02:18:04
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>There will be excuses, there

3802
02:18:04 --> 02:18:09
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>will be a lessening of effort,

3803
02:18:09 --> 02:18:11
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>and both bnsf and metrolink have

3804
02:18:11 --> 02:18:12
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>made very strong efforts to

3805
02:18:12 --> 02:18:17
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>comply with 2015.

3806
02:18:17 --> 02:18:22
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>Why change it?

3807
02:18:22 --> 02:18:23
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>The los angeles area is a huge

3808
02:18:23 --> 02:18:24
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>commuter area.

3809
02:18:24 --> 02:18:28
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>And when it's not necessary to

3810
02:18:28 --> 02:18:30
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>change it, why do it?

3811
02:18:30 --> 02:18:33
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>The national requirement to

3812
02:18:33 --> 02:18:35
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>deploy this system by 2015

3813
02:18:35 --> 02:18:39
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>creates a substantial incentive

3814
02:18:39 --> 02:18:40
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>for industry to develop new and

3815
02:18:40 --> 02:18:43
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>cost-effective technology that

3816
02:18:43 --> 02:18:46
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>lowers the deployment cost for

3817
02:18:46 --> 02:18:48
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>everyone, including metrolink.

3818
02:18:48 --> 02:18:51
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>A national strategy which will

3819
02:18:51 --> 02:18:53
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>hopefully be presented in the

3820
02:18:53 --> 02:18:57
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>f.R.A.'s 2012 report to congress

3821
02:18:57 --> 02:18:59
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>could play a significant role in

3822
02:18:59 --> 02:19:01
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>addressing positive train

3823
02:19:01 --> 02:19:04
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>control deployment barriers.

3824
02:19:04 --> 02:19:07
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>This system can prevent human

3825
02:19:07 --> 02:19:10
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>errors from causing collisions,

3826
02:19:10 --> 02:19:11
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>dangerous releases of hazardous

3827
02:19:11 --> 02:19:13
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>materials, and passengers and

3828
02:19:13 --> 02:19:15
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>train crews from being killed

3829
02:19:15 --> 02:19:17
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>and injured.

3830
02:19:17 --> 02:19:19
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>So I make these remarks today in

3831
02:19:19 --> 02:19:23
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>the hopes that there will be

3832
02:19:23 --> 02:19:26
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>support in this body for the

3833
02:19:26 --> 02:19:28
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>2015 deadline, and I really

3834
02:19:29 --> 02:19:33
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>appeal to the committee that

3835
02:19:33 --> 02:19:34
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>right now is locked in at 2018.

3836
02:19:34 --> 02:19:35
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>We have tried.

3837
02:19:35 --> 02:19:40
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>We have talked to the staff.

3838
02:19:40 --> 02:19:42
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>We have been rejected.

3839
02:19:42 --> 02:19:44
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>To understand that what they are

3840
02:19:44 --> 02:19:46
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>delaying is a device that saves

3841
02:19:46 --> 02:19:48
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>lives.

3842
02:19:48 --> 02:19:50
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>And there is no excuse for so

3843
02:19:50 --> 02:19:51
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>doing.

3844
02:19:51 --> 02:19:52
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>The case has not been made to do

3845
02:19:52 --> 02:19:53
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>so.

3846
02:19:53 --> 02:19:54
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>the hearings have not taken

3847
02:19:54 --> 02:19:58
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>place.

3848
02:19:58 --> 02:20:00
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>There was no markup to add this.

3849
02:20:00 --> 02:20:03
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>And I strongly believe it should

3850
02:20:03 --> 02:20:05
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>not be delayed in this bill.

3851
02:20:05 --> 02:20:08
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>I hope members will listen.

3852
02:20:08 --> 02:20:10
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>I hope they will respond.

3853
02:20:10 --> 02:20:13
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>You know, hundreds of thousands

3854
02:20:13 --> 02:20:15
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>of commuters are at risk until

3855
02:20:15 --> 02:20:17
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>this system is put into place.

3856
02:20:17 --> 02:20:21
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>I thank you, Madam President.

3857
02:20:21 --> 02:20:22
<v MRS. FEINSTEIN>I yield the floor.

3858
02:20:22 --> 02:20:23
<v MR. PAUL>Madam President?

3859
02:20:22 --> 02:20:24
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

3860
02:20:24 --> 02:20:25
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senator from kentucky.

3861
02:20:26 --> 02:20:30
<v MR. PAUL>dependency often leads

3862
02:20:30 --> 02:20:39
<v MR. PAUL>to insew lens, I understand

3863
02:20:39 --> 02:20:41
<v MR. PAUL>insolence,desolence,

3864
02:20:41 --> 02:20:42
<v MR. PAUL>lethargy, and ultimately

3865
02:20:42 --> 02:20:43
<v MR. PAUL>insolence.

3866
02:20:43 --> 02:20:45
<v MR. PAUL>Egypt has been receiving aid

3867
02:20:45 --> 02:20:45
<v MR. PAUL>from united states for over 60

3868
02:20:45 --> 02:20:47
<v MR. PAUL>years.

3869
02:20:47 --> 02:20:49
<v MR. PAUL>America has lavished over

3870
02:20:49 --> 02:20:49
<v MR. PAUL>$60 billion to the government of

3871
02:20:49 --> 02:20:53
<v MR. PAUL>egypt.

3872
02:20:53 --> 02:20:55
<v MR. PAUL>And they react with dislens and

3873
02:20:55 --> 02:20:56
<v MR. PAUL>disregard in detaining 19 of our

3874
02:20:56 --> 02:20:57
<v MR. PAUL>U.S. Citizens.

3875
02:20:57 --> 02:20:58
<v MR. PAUL>for months now, these citizens

3876
02:20:58 --> 02:21:00
<v MR. PAUL>have been essentially held

3877
02:21:00 --> 02:21:02
<v MR. PAUL>hostage, unable to leave egypt,

3878
02:21:02 --> 02:21:03
<v MR. PAUL>held on the pretense of

3879
02:21:03 --> 02:21:05
<v MR. PAUL>trumped-up political charges,

3880
02:21:05 --> 02:21:08
<v MR. PAUL>held in order to display them in

3881
02:21:08 --> 02:21:09
<v MR. PAUL>show trials to placate the mob.

3882
02:21:09 --> 02:21:11
<v MR. PAUL>The united states can respond in

3883
02:21:11 --> 02:21:14
<v MR. PAUL>one of two ways.

3884
02:21:14 --> 02:21:15
<v MR. PAUL>We can hang our head low.

3885
02:21:16 --> 02:21:17
<v MR. PAUL>We can take the tack of jimmy

3886
02:21:17 --> 02:21:19
<v MR. PAUL>carter.

3887
02:21:19 --> 02:21:20
<v MR. PAUL>We can try to placate egypt with

3888
02:21:20 --> 02:21:21
<v MR. PAUL>concessions and offer them

3889
02:21:21 --> 02:21:24
<v MR. PAUL>bribes in the form of more

3890
02:21:24 --> 02:21:25
<v MR. PAUL>government aid.

3891
02:21:25 --> 02:21:27
<v MR. PAUL>Or america can respond with

3892
02:21:27 --> 02:21:29
<v MR. PAUL>strength.

3893
02:21:29 --> 02:21:32
<v MR. PAUL>The President Should today call

3894
02:21:32 --> 02:21:35
<v MR. PAUL>the egyptian ambassador in and

3895
02:21:35 --> 02:21:36
<v MR. PAUL>send him home with a message, a

3896
02:21:36 --> 02:21:38
<v MR. PAUL>message that america will not

3897
02:21:38 --> 02:21:40
<v MR. PAUL>tolerate any country holding

3898
02:21:40 --> 02:21:42
<v MR. PAUL>U.S. Citizens as political

3899
02:21:42 --> 02:21:45
<v MR. PAUL>prisoners.

3900
02:21:45 --> 02:21:47
<v MR. PAUL>Congress should act today to

3901
02:21:47 --> 02:21:49
<v MR. PAUL>tell egypt that we will no

3902
02:21:49 --> 02:21:52
<v MR. PAUL>longer send our annual welfare

3903
02:21:52 --> 02:21:55
<v MR. PAUL>check to them, that this year's

3904
02:21:55 --> 02:21:58
<v MR. PAUL>$1.8 billion is not on the way.

3905
02:21:58 --> 02:22:00
<v MR. PAUL>america could put egyptian

3906
02:22:00 --> 02:22:01
<v MR. PAUL>travelers on notice that the

3907
02:22:01 --> 02:22:04
<v MR. PAUL>welcome sign in america will

3908
02:22:04 --> 02:22:06
<v MR. PAUL>temporarily expire unless the

3909
02:22:06 --> 02:22:09
<v MR. PAUL>egyptian government lets our

3910
02:22:09 --> 02:22:11
<v MR. PAUL>people go.

3911
02:22:11 --> 02:22:13
<v MR. PAUL>Or america could hang her head,

3912
02:22:13 --> 02:22:15
<v MR. PAUL>promise to continue the foreign

3913
02:22:15 --> 02:22:17
<v MR. PAUL>aid to egypt and apologize for

3914
02:22:17 --> 02:22:19
<v MR. PAUL>supporting democracy.

3915
02:22:19 --> 02:22:22
<v MR. PAUL>which will it be?

3916
02:22:22 --> 02:22:23
<v MR. PAUL>So far, the signal sent to egypt

3917
02:22:23 --> 02:22:26
<v MR. PAUL>from the President And from the

3918
02:22:26 --> 02:22:27
<v MR. PAUL>senate have been weak or

3919
02:22:27 --> 02:22:30
<v MR. PAUL>counterproductive.

3920
02:22:30 --> 02:22:31
<v MR. PAUL>In late January, the President's

3921
02:22:31 --> 02:22:33
<v MR. PAUL>under secretary of state said to

3922
02:22:33 --> 02:22:35
<v MR. PAUL>the administration that he

3923
02:22:35 --> 02:22:37
<v MR. PAUL>wanted to provide more immediate

3924
02:22:37 --> 02:22:39
<v MR. PAUL>benefits to egypt, let's speed

3925
02:22:39 --> 02:22:41
<v MR. PAUL>up the welfare checks.

3926
02:22:41 --> 02:22:44
<v MR. PAUL>The President's budget this week

3927
02:22:44 --> 02:22:46
<v MR. PAUL>still continues to include

3928
02:22:46 --> 02:22:48
<v MR. PAUL>$1.8 billion for egypt, without

3929
02:22:48 --> 02:22:50
<v MR. PAUL>a single word of rebuke or any

3930
02:22:50 --> 02:22:51
<v MR. PAUL>demand that our U.S. Citizens be

3931
02:22:51 --> 02:22:53
<v MR. PAUL>released.

3932
02:22:53 --> 02:22:54
<v MR. PAUL>The President Went one step

3933
02:22:54 --> 02:22:55
<v MR. PAUL>further when he actually

3934
02:22:55 --> 02:22:57
<v MR. PAUL>increased foreign aid to the

3935
02:22:57 --> 02:22:59
<v MR. PAUL>middle east in his budget.

3936
02:22:59 --> 02:23:04
<v MR. PAUL>and now the senate refuses to

3937
02:23:04 --> 02:23:05
<v MR. PAUL>hold a single vote, to spend 10

3938
02:23:05 --> 02:23:08
<v MR. PAUL>minutes discussing why U.S.

3939
02:23:08 --> 02:23:08
<v MR. PAUL>Citizens are being detained in

3940
02:23:08 --> 02:23:10
<v MR. PAUL>egypt.

3941
02:23:10 --> 02:23:11
<v MR. PAUL>One might excuse the egyptians

3942
02:23:11 --> 02:23:13
<v MR. PAUL>for not believing that we will

3943
02:23:13 --> 02:23:15
<v MR. PAUL>cut their aid.

3944
02:23:15 --> 02:23:17
<v MR. PAUL>You can't lead from behind.

3945
02:23:17 --> 02:23:20
<v MR. PAUL>Senate leadership appears

3946
02:23:20 --> 02:23:22
<v MR. PAUL>unwilling to address this issue

3947
02:23:22 --> 02:23:23
<v MR. PAUL>head-on so the senate won't act

3948
02:23:23 --> 02:23:24
<v MR. PAUL>to help out our citizens this

3949
02:23:24 --> 02:23:25
<v MR. PAUL>week.

3950
02:23:25 --> 02:23:28
<v MR. PAUL>But I hope when senators return

3951
02:23:28 --> 02:23:30
<v MR. PAUL>home, when senators talk to

3952
02:23:30 --> 02:23:31
<v MR. PAUL>their constituents in their

3953
02:23:31 --> 02:23:32
<v MR. PAUL>state, I hope that their

3954
02:23:32 --> 02:23:35
<v MR. PAUL>constituents will ask these

3955
02:23:35 --> 02:23:36
<v MR. PAUL>questions --

3956
02:23:36 --> 02:23:38
<v MR. PAUL>senator, why do you continue to

3957
02:23:38 --> 02:23:39
<v MR. PAUL>send our taxpayer money to egypt

3958
02:23:39 --> 02:23:41
<v MR. PAUL>egypt?

3959
02:23:41 --> 02:23:42
<v MR. PAUL>Why do you continue to send our

3960
02:23:42 --> 02:23:44
<v MR. PAUL>money to egypt when they he

3961
02:23:44 --> 02:23:46
<v MR. PAUL>taken our citizens?

3962
02:23:46 --> 02:23:46
<v MR. PAUL>-- when they detain our

3963
02:23:46 --> 02:23:47
<v MR. PAUL>citizens?

3964
02:23:47 --> 02:23:49
<v MR. PAUL>Senator, why do you continue to

3965
02:23:49 --> 02:23:51
<v MR. PAUL>send billions of dollars to

3966
02:23:51 --> 02:23:53
<v MR. PAUL>egypt when 12 million americans

3967
02:23:53 --> 02:23:55
<v MR. PAUL>are out of work?

3968
02:23:55 --> 02:23:57
<v MR. PAUL>Senator, why do you continue to

3969
02:23:57 --> 02:23:59
<v MR. PAUL>send welfare to foreign

3970
02:23:59 --> 02:24:01
<v MR. PAUL>countries when our bridges are

3971
02:24:01 --> 02:24:03
<v MR. PAUL>falling down and in desperate

3972
02:24:03 --> 02:24:06
<v MR. PAUL>need of repair?

3973
02:24:06 --> 02:24:08
<v MR. PAUL>Senator, how can you continue to

3974
02:24:08 --> 02:24:11
<v MR. PAUL>flush our taxpayer money down a

3975
02:24:11 --> 02:24:14
<v MR. PAUL>foreign drain when we are

3976
02:24:14 --> 02:24:16
<v MR. PAUL>borrowing $40,000 a second?

3977
02:24:16 --> 02:24:18
<v MR. PAUL>The money we send to egypt we

3978
02:24:18 --> 02:24:20
<v MR. PAUL>must first borrow from china.

3979
02:24:20 --> 02:24:22
<v MR. PAUL>that is an insanity and it must

3980
02:24:22 --> 02:24:25
<v MR. PAUL>end.

3981
02:24:25 --> 02:24:26
<v MR. PAUL>And, finally, Mr. Senator, I

3982
02:24:26 --> 02:24:27
<v MR. PAUL>hope your constituents ask you

3983
02:24:27 --> 02:24:29
<v MR. PAUL>this when you go home.

3984
02:24:29 --> 02:24:30
<v MR. PAUL>When working families are

3985
02:24:30 --> 02:24:32
<v MR. PAUL>suffering under rising food

3986
02:24:32 --> 02:24:34
<v MR. PAUL>prices, when working families

3987
02:24:34 --> 02:24:36
<v MR. PAUL>are suffering because gas prices

3988
02:24:36 --> 02:24:39
<v MR. PAUL>have doubled, how can you

3989
02:24:39 --> 02:24:43
<v MR. PAUL>justify sending our hard-earned

3990
02:24:43 --> 02:24:45
<v MR. PAUL>taxpayer dollars to egypt, to

3991
02:24:45 --> 02:24:47
<v MR. PAUL>countries that openly show their

3992
02:24:48 --> 02:24:50
<v MR. PAUL>disdain for us?

3993
02:24:50 --> 02:24:52
<v MR. PAUL>When will we learn?

3994
02:24:52 --> 02:24:54
<v MR. PAUL>You can't buy friendship and you

3995
02:24:54 --> 02:24:58
<v MR. PAUL>can't convince authoritarians to

3996
02:24:58 --> 02:25:00
<v MR. PAUL>love freedom.

3997
02:25:00 --> 02:25:01
<v MR. PAUL>with welfare checks.

3998
02:25:01 --> 02:25:03
<v MR. PAUL>America needs to send a clear

3999
02:25:03 --> 02:25:04
<v MR. PAUL>and unequivocal message to egypt

4000
02:25:04 --> 02:25:09
<v MR. PAUL>that we will not tolerate the

4001
02:25:09 --> 02:25:10
<v MR. PAUL>detention of U.S. Citizens on

4002
02:25:10 --> 02:25:11
<v MR. PAUL>trumped-up political charges or

4003
02:25:11 --> 02:25:13
<v MR. PAUL>otherwise.

4004
02:25:13 --> 02:25:17
<v MR. PAUL>And that we will not continue to

4005
02:25:17 --> 02:25:19
<v MR. PAUL>send welfare checks to egypt, to

4006
02:25:19 --> 02:25:20
<v MR. PAUL>a country that commits an

4007
02:25:20 --> 02:25:23
<v MR. PAUL>injustice to american citizens.

4008
02:25:23 --> 02:25:24
<v MR. PAUL>So, Mr. President, I ask today

4009
02:25:24 --> 02:25:26
<v MR. PAUL>unanimous consent to set aside

4010
02:25:26 --> 02:25:28
<v MR. PAUL>the pending amendment and call

4011
02:25:28 --> 02:25:29
<v MR. PAUL>up my amendment on egypt that

4012
02:25:29 --> 02:25:31
<v MR. PAUL>would end all foreign aid to

4013
02:25:31 --> 02:25:33
<v MR. PAUL>egypt if our U.S. Citizens are

4014
02:25:33 --> 02:25:34
<v MR. PAUL>not released within 30 days.

4015
02:25:34 --> 02:25:38
<v MR. PAUL>I think this is an important

4016
02:25:38 --> 02:25:40
<v MR. PAUL>amendment, deserves discussion

4017
02:25:40 --> 02:25:41
<v MR. PAUL>and egypt deserves to hear a

4018
02:25:41 --> 02:25:42
<v MR. PAUL>message from the united states

4019
02:25:42 --> 02:25:43
<v MR. PAUL>senate that we will not tolerate

4020
02:25:43 --> 02:25:44
<v MR. PAUL>this.

4021
02:25:44 --> 02:25:46
<v MR. PAUL>Mr. President, I ask unanimous

4022
02:25:46 --> 02:25:46
<v MR. PAUL>consent to bring up amendment

4023
02:25:46 --> 02:25:47
<v MR. PAUL>1541.

4024
02:25:47 --> 02:25:48
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>is there

4025
02:25:48 --> 02:25:49
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection?

4026
02:25:49 --> 02:25:53
<v MRS. BOXER>Madam President,

4027
02:25:53 --> 02:25:54
<v MRS. BOXER>reserving the right to object.

4028
02:25:54 --> 02:25:55
<v MRS. BOXER>I want to be very clear here.

4029
02:25:54 --> 02:25:55
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

4030
02:25:56 --> 02:25:56
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senator from california.

4031
02:25:57 --> 02:25:58
<v MRS. BOXER>I want to be very

4032
02:25:58 --> 02:26:00
<v MRS. BOXER>clear here that members on both

4033
02:26:00 --> 02:26:04
<v MRS. BOXER>sides of the aisle, republicans

4034
02:26:04 --> 02:26:05
<v MRS. BOXER>and democrats, have very strong

4035
02:26:05 --> 02:26:06
<v MRS. BOXER>feelings that this amendment

4036
02:26:06 --> 02:26:07
<v MRS. BOXER>should not be brought up at this

4037
02:26:07 --> 02:26:08
<v MRS. BOXER>time.

4038
02:26:08 --> 02:26:11
<v MRS. BOXER>We need to be smart and

4039
02:26:11 --> 02:26:13
<v MRS. BOXER>strategic when we have people in

4040
02:26:13 --> 02:26:14
<v MRS. BOXER>harm's way in another country.

4041
02:26:14 --> 02:26:16
<v MRS. BOXER>Now, further, I think it's

4042
02:26:16 --> 02:26:19
<v MRS. BOXER>important to note what senator

4043
02:26:19 --> 02:26:21
<v MRS. BOXER>leahy has said several times,

4044
02:26:21 --> 02:26:24
<v MRS. BOXER>which is already in law we have

4045
02:26:24 --> 02:26:26
<v MRS. BOXER>certain conditions placed upon

4046
02:26:26 --> 02:26:27
<v MRS. BOXER>aid to egypt and I think that

4047
02:26:27 --> 02:26:28
<v MRS. BOXER>needs to be understood and

4048
02:26:28 --> 02:26:31
<v MRS. BOXER>explored.

4049
02:26:31 --> 02:26:32
<v MRS. BOXER>So I feel because there's so

4050
02:26:32 --> 02:26:34
<v MRS. BOXER>much objection to this amendment

4051
02:26:34 --> 02:26:35
<v MRS. BOXER>being brought up at this time, I

4052
02:26:35 --> 02:26:36
<v MRS. BOXER>will object.

4053
02:26:36 --> 02:26:47
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection

4054
02:26:47 --> 02:26:48
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>is heard.

4055
02:26:51 --> 02:26:53
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

4056
02:26:53 --> 02:26:54
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senator from iowa.

4057
02:26:54 --> 02:26:57
<v MR. GRASSLEY>I'd like to ask

4058
02:26:57 --> 02:26:59
<v MR. GRASSLEY>unanimous consent to speak as if

4059
02:26:59 --> 02:27:00
<v MR. GRASSLEY>in morning business for about 15

4060
02:27:00 --> 02:27:00
<v MR. GRASSLEY>minutes.

4061
02:27:00 --> 02:27:07
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

4062
02:27:07 --> 02:27:08
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

4063
02:27:08 --> 02:27:13
<v MR. GRASSLEY>if a republican

4064
02:27:13 --> 02:27:16
<v MR. GRASSLEY>like me, like this senator, says

4065
02:27:16 --> 02:27:18
<v MR. GRASSLEY>that the President's 2013 budget

4066
02:27:18 --> 02:27:23
<v MR. GRASSLEY>doesn't pass the smell test, i

4067
02:27:23 --> 02:27:24
<v MR. GRASSLEY>would probably have half the

4068
02:27:24 --> 02:27:28
<v MR. GRASSLEY>country questioning judgment.

4069
02:27:28 --> 02:27:31
<v MR. GRASSLEY>But I would like to quote

4070
02:27:31 --> 02:27:32
<v MR. GRASSLEY>&quot;washington post's&quot; dana

4071
02:27:32 --> 02:27:34
<v MR. GRASSLEY>milbank's comments on the

4072
02:27:34 --> 02:27:39
<v MR. GRASSLEY>President's budget.

4073
02:27:39 --> 02:27:40
<v MR. GRASSLEY>This was recently in &quot;the

4074
02:27:40 --> 02:27:42
<v MR. GRASSLEY>washington post,&quot; these words,

4075
02:27:42 --> 02:27:44
<v MR. GRASSLEY>by a columnist who I think

4076
02:27:44 --> 02:27:47
<v MR. GRASSLEY>generally is pretty favorable

4077
02:27:47 --> 02:27:50
<v MR. GRASSLEY>towards President Obama as a

4078
02:27:50 --> 02:27:52
<v MR. GRASSLEY>person and his administration.

4079
02:27:52 --> 02:27:56
<v MR. GRASSLEY>But there's great disagreement

4080
02:27:56 --> 02:27:57
<v MR. GRASSLEY>by this columnist about the

4081
02:27:57 --> 02:27:59
<v MR. GRASSLEY>President's budget.

4082
02:27:59 --> 02:28:03
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Quote -- &quot;the white house budget

4083
02:28:03 --> 02:28:06
<v MR. GRASSLEY>for fiscal 2013 begins with a

4084
02:28:06 --> 02:28:09
<v MR. GRASSLEY>broken promise, adds some phony

4085
02:28:09 --> 02:28:12
<v MR. GRASSLEY>policy assumptions, throws in a

4086
02:28:12 --> 02:28:17
<v MR. GRASSLEY>few rosy forecasts, and omits

4087
02:28:17 --> 02:28:19
<v MR. GRASSLEY>all kinds of painful decisions.

4088
02:28:19 --> 02:28:21
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Even then,&quot; the columnist

4089
02:28:21 --> 02:28:23
<v MR. GRASSLEY>continues, &quot;the proposal would

4090
02:28:23 --> 02:28:25
<v MR. GRASSLEY>add $1 trillion more to the

4091
02:28:25 --> 02:28:27
<v MR. GRASSLEY>national debt than obama

4092
02:28:27 --> 02:28:32
<v MR. GRASSLEY>contemplated just a few months

4093
02:28:32 --> 02:28:35
<v MR. GRASSLEY>ago.&quot;

4094
02:28:35 --> 02:28:38
<v MR. GRASSLEY>dana milbank added that the

4095
02:28:38 --> 02:28:41
<v MR. GRASSLEY>obama budget -- quote -- &quot;is a

4096
02:28:41 --> 02:28:43
<v MR. GRASSLEY>non-starter on capitol hill,

4097
02:28:43 --> 02:28:46
<v MR. GRASSLEY>where even senate democrats have

4098
02:28:46 --> 02:28:48
<v MR. GRASSLEY>no plans to take it up.

4099
02:28:48 --> 02:28:51
<v MR. GRASSLEY>It is, in other words, exactly

4100
02:28:51 --> 02:28:55
<v MR. GRASSLEY>what it was supposed to be -- a

4101
02:28:55 --> 02:28:56
<v MR. GRASSLEY>campaign document.&quot;

4102
02:28:56 --> 02:29:00
<v MR. GRASSLEY>so with that background from

4103
02:29:00 --> 02:29:04
<v MR. GRASSLEY>somebody who is not a member of

4104
02:29:04 --> 02:29:05
<v MR. GRASSLEY>congress, not -- not a

4105
02:29:05 --> 02:29:07
<v MR. GRASSLEY>republican or democrat -- I

4106
02:29:07 --> 02:29:09
<v MR. GRASSLEY>don't know how they might be

4107
02:29:09 --> 02:29:11
<v MR. GRASSLEY>registered -- I would like to

4108
02:29:11 --> 02:29:17
<v MR. GRASSLEY>give my views on the President's

4109
02:29:17 --> 02:29:18
<v MR. GRASSLEY>budget but just so that people

4110
02:29:18 --> 02:29:19
<v MR. GRASSLEY>know that it isn't just

4111
02:29:19 --> 02:29:22
<v MR. GRASSLEY>republicans that disagree with

4112
02:29:22 --> 02:29:23
<v MR. GRASSLEY>the President's budget.

4113
02:29:24 --> 02:29:27
<v MR. GRASSLEY>I think you could sum up the

4114
02:29:27 --> 02:29:29
<v MR. GRASSLEY>president's budget with three

4115
02:29:29 --> 02:29:32
<v MR. GRASSLEY>words that might say you're

4116
02:29:32 --> 02:29:33
<v MR. GRASSLEY>giving it a &quot;d&quot; grade and

4117
02:29:33 --> 02:29:36
<v MR. GRASSLEY>probably most people would give

4118
02:29:36 --> 02:29:38
<v MR. GRASSLEY>it an &quot;f&quot; grade.

4119
02:29:38 --> 02:29:39
<v MR. GRASSLEY>But it would be debt, deficit,

4120
02:29:39 --> 02:29:44
<v MR. GRASSLEY>distrust and disaster.

4121
02:29:44 --> 02:29:46
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Too much spending.

4122
02:29:46 --> 02:29:49
<v MR. GRASSLEY>too much taxing.

4123
02:29:49 --> 02:29:52
<v MR. GRASSLEY>And too much debt.

4124
02:29:52 --> 02:29:53
<v MR. GRASSLEY>So this comes from the fact that

4125
02:29:53 --> 02:29:55
<v MR. GRASSLEY>earlier this week, the President

4126
02:29:55 --> 02:29:59
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Submitted, as he has to every

4127
02:29:59 --> 02:30:01
<v MR. GRASSLEY>year, a budget proposal and this

4128
02:30:01 --> 02:30:02
<v MR. GRASSLEY>budget proposal was all too

4129
02:30:02 --> 02:30:05
<v MR. GRASSLEY>predictable.

4130
02:30:05 --> 02:30:08
<v MR. GRASSLEY>It was predictable because it

4131
02:30:08 --> 02:30:11
<v MR. GRASSLEY>follows the same path as his

4132
02:30:11 --> 02:30:12
<v MR. GRASSLEY>previous three budgets.

4133
02:30:12 --> 02:30:14
<v MR. GRASSLEY>With breathtaking

4134
02:30:14 --> 02:30:17
<v MR. GRASSLEY>irresponsibility, the

4135
02:30:17 --> 02:30:18
<v MR. GRASSLEY>President's 2013 budget would

4136
02:30:18 --> 02:30:22
<v MR. GRASSLEY>expand the scope of government

4137
02:30:22 --> 02:30:24
<v MR. GRASSLEY>by spending more money, increase

4138
02:30:24 --> 02:30:26
<v MR. GRASSLEY>taxes on job creators,

4139
02:30:26 --> 02:30:29
<v MR. GRASSLEY>particularly small business, and

4140
02:30:29 --> 02:30:32
<v MR. GRASSLEY>continue on the path of enormous

4141
02:30:32 --> 02:30:34
<v MR. GRASSLEY>deficits and record debt.

4142
02:30:34 --> 02:30:36
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Deja vu.

4143
02:30:36 --> 02:30:38
<v MR. GRASSLEY>The President's budget proposal

4144
02:30:38 --> 02:30:41
<v MR. GRASSLEY>is supposed to be a serious

4145
02:30:41 --> 02:30:44
<v MR. GRASSLEY>document, a document that lays

4146
02:30:44 --> 02:30:46
<v MR. GRASSLEY>out the President's priorities

4147
02:30:46 --> 02:30:50
<v MR. GRASSLEY>along with the President's ideas

4148
02:30:50 --> 02:30:52
<v MR. GRASSLEY>on how to address our national

4149
02:30:52 --> 02:30:57
<v MR. GRASSLEY>fiscal and economic challenges.

4150
02:30:57 --> 02:30:57
<v MR. GRASSLEY>This budget fails those goals

4151
02:30:57 --> 02:30:58
<v MR. GRASSLEY>miserably.

4152
02:30:58 --> 02:31:01
<v MR. GRASSLEY>As a member of the budget

4153
02:31:01 --> 02:31:03
<v MR. GRASSLEY>committee, I've heard from

4154
02:31:03 --> 02:31:04
<v MR. GRASSLEY>numerous experts who come before

4155
02:31:04 --> 02:31:07
<v MR. GRASSLEY>that committee about the need

4156
02:31:07 --> 02:31:10
<v MR. GRASSLEY>for congress and the president

4157
02:31:10 --> 02:31:13
<v MR. GRASSLEY>to get serious about fiscal

4158
02:31:13 --> 02:31:15
<v MR. GRASSLEY>cliff that we're approaching.

4159
02:31:15 --> 02:31:17
<v MR. GRASSLEY>We've had deficit commissions --

4160
02:31:17 --> 02:31:20
<v MR. GRASSLEY>you remember simpson-bowles as

4161
02:31:20 --> 02:31:23
<v MR. GRASSLEY>an example -- we've had task

4162
02:31:23 --> 02:31:26
<v MR. GRASSLEY>forces, and we have had what we

4163
02:31:26 --> 02:31:29
<v MR. GRASSLEY>call gangs -- you know, gang of

4164
02:31:29 --> 02:31:31
<v MR. GRASSLEY>six, six senators trying to work

4165
02:31:31 --> 02:31:32
<v MR. GRASSLEY>something out -- and other

4166
02:31:32 --> 02:31:34
<v MR. GRASSLEY>members of congress.

4167
02:31:34 --> 02:31:37
<v MR. GRASSLEY>All of these have put forward

4168
02:31:37 --> 02:31:39
<v MR. GRASSLEY>deficit-reduction plans.

4169
02:31:39 --> 02:31:42
<v MR. GRASSLEY>However, it's going to take more

4170
02:31:42 --> 02:31:44
<v MR. GRASSLEY>than a commission -- and the

4171
02:31:44 --> 02:31:45
<v MR. GRASSLEY>President Didn't even back the

4172
02:31:45 --> 02:31:46
<v MR. GRASSLEY>recommendations of his own

4173
02:31:46 --> 02:31:48
<v MR. GRASSLEY>commission a year ago.

4174
02:31:48 --> 02:31:49
<v MR. GRASSLEY>It's going to take more than

4175
02:31:49 --> 02:31:51
<v MR. GRASSLEY>task forces.

4176
02:31:51 --> 02:31:55
<v MR. GRASSLEY>It's going to take more than

4177
02:31:55 --> 02:31:56
<v MR. GRASSLEY>gangs of senators.

4178
02:31:56 --> 02:31:57
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Because the single-most

4179
02:31:57 --> 02:32:01
<v MR. GRASSLEY>important political and moral

4180
02:32:01 --> 02:32:02
<v MR. GRASSLEY>leader in america is whoever

4181
02:32:02 --> 02:32:04
<v MR. GRASSLEY>holds the presidency of the

4182
02:32:04 --> 02:32:07
<v MR. GRASSLEY>united states, and in this

4183
02:32:07 --> 02:32:09
<v MR. GRASSLEY>particular instance of this

4184
02:32:09 --> 02:32:12
<v MR. GRASSLEY>executive budget, that person

4185
02:32:12 --> 02:32:14
<v MR. GRASSLEY>and that document has failed to

4186
02:32:14 --> 02:32:17
<v MR. GRASSLEY>lead on this critical issue.

4187
02:32:17 --> 02:32:18
<v MR. GRASSLEY>And it doesn't matter how many

4188
02:32:18 --> 02:32:20
<v MR. GRASSLEY>commissions, how many task

4189
02:32:20 --> 02:32:21
<v MR. GRASSLEY>forces and how many gangs of

4190
02:32:21 --> 02:32:22
<v MR. GRASSLEY>senators you have.

4191
02:32:22 --> 02:32:24
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Without presidential

4192
02:32:24 --> 02:32:26
<v MR. GRASSLEY>participation, a problem as big

4193
02:32:26 --> 02:32:31
<v MR. GRASSLEY>as this country's national debt

4194
02:32:31 --> 02:32:31
<v MR. GRASSLEY>is never going to be solved.

4195
02:32:31 --> 02:32:34
<v MR. GRASSLEY>What President Obama put forward

4196
02:32:34 --> 02:32:37
<v MR. GRASSLEY>on monday of this week is not a

4197
02:32:37 --> 02:32:38
<v MR. GRASSLEY>serious budget, as I said

4198
02:32:38 --> 02:32:39
<v MR. GRASSLEY>before; it is a political

4199
02:32:39 --> 02:32:41
<v MR. GRASSLEY>statement.

4200
02:32:41 --> 02:32:44
<v MR. GRASSLEY>The fact is, americans are going

4201
02:32:44 --> 02:32:47
<v MR. GRASSLEY>to pay a heavy price for the

4202
02:32:48 --> 02:32:50
<v MR. GRASSLEY>President's unwillingness and

4203
02:32:50 --> 02:32:51
<v MR. GRASSLEY>inability to lead.

4204
02:32:51 --> 02:32:53
<v MR. GRASSLEY>While President Obama claims

4205
02:32:53 --> 02:32:57
<v MR. GRASSLEY>that his budget will create an

4206
02:32:57 --> 02:32:59
<v MR. GRASSLEY>american built to last, the only

4207
02:32:59 --> 02:33:02
<v MR. GRASSLEY>thing his budget builds are

4208
02:33:02 --> 02:33:04
<v MR. GRASSLEY>higher deficits and debt; a

4209
02:33:04 --> 02:33:06
<v MR. GRASSLEY>bigger, more intrusive

4210
02:33:06 --> 02:33:08
<v MR. GRASSLEY>government, and economic decline

4211
02:33:08 --> 02:33:12
<v MR. GRASSLEY>for future generations.

4212
02:33:12 --> 02:33:12
<v MR. GRASSLEY>and you want to remember that

4213
02:33:12 --> 02:33:15
<v MR. GRASSLEY>more important than the economic

4214
02:33:15 --> 02:33:20
<v MR. GRASSLEY>points of a budget is when you

4215
02:33:20 --> 02:33:22
<v MR. GRASSLEY>get a more intrusive government,

4216
02:33:22 --> 02:33:25
<v MR. GRASSLEY>the less economic and social

4217
02:33:25 --> 02:33:29
<v MR. GRASSLEY>freedom that people have.

4218
02:33:29 --> 02:33:31
<v MR. GRASSLEY>By nearly every fiscal measure,

4219
02:33:31 --> 02:33:34
<v MR. GRASSLEY>president obama's budget makes

4220
02:33:34 --> 02:33:36
<v MR. GRASSLEY>matters much worse.

4221
02:33:36 --> 02:33:38
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Not only has the President

4222
02:33:38 --> 02:33:41
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Chosen to ignore the looming

4223
02:33:41 --> 02:33:44
<v MR. GRASSLEY>fiscal catastrophe, he's chosen

4224
02:33:44 --> 02:33:46
<v MR. GRASSLEY>to continue course and even step

4225
02:33:46 --> 02:33:48
<v MR. GRASSLEY>on the accelerator.

4226
02:33:48 --> 02:33:53
<v MR. GRASSLEY>This year the federal government

4227
02:33:53 --> 02:33:55
<v MR. GRASSLEY>will spend $3.8 trillion, equal

4228
02:33:55 --> 02:33:57
<v MR. GRASSLEY>to 24.1 purr

4229
02:33:57 --> 02:34:00
<v MR. GRASSLEY>% of our G.D.P.

4230
02:34:00 --> 02:34:03
<v MR. GRASSLEY>During the past six year, we've

4231
02:34:03 --> 02:34:05
<v MR. GRASSLEY>averaged about 21% of G.D.P.

4232
02:34:05 --> 02:34:07
<v MR. GRASSLEY>So you quantify government

4233
02:34:07 --> 02:34:10
<v MR. GRASSLEY>growing dramatically, from

4234
02:34:10 --> 02:34:14
<v MR. GRASSLEY>taking 21% out of the economy

4235
02:34:14 --> 02:34:15
<v MR. GRASSLEY>that government spends, 535

4236
02:34:15 --> 02:34:19
<v MR. GRASSLEY>members of congress spend

4237
02:34:19 --> 02:34:19
<v MR. GRASSLEY>instead of 300 million

4238
02:34:19 --> 02:34:26
<v MR. GRASSLEY>americans.

4239
02:34:26 --> 02:34:28
<v MR. GRASSLEY>And that's raised to 24.3%.

4240
02:34:28 --> 02:34:31
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Alarmingly, over the ten-year

4241
02:34:31 --> 02:34:35
<v MR. GRASSLEY>budget that we look ahead in the

4242
02:34:35 --> 02:34:38
<v MR. GRASSLEY>2013 budget, this budget

4243
02:34:38 --> 02:34:42
<v MR. GRASSLEY>spending never gets below 22%.

4244
02:34:42 --> 02:34:44
<v MR. GRASSLEY>So forever they're growing

4245
02:34:44 --> 02:34:46
<v MR. GRASSLEY>government and detracting from

4246
02:34:46 --> 02:34:49
<v MR. GRASSLEY>individual freedom.

4247
02:34:49 --> 02:34:50
<v MR. GRASSLEY>He -- the President Intends to

4248
02:34:50 --> 02:34:52
<v MR. GRASSLEY>lock in historically high levels

4249
02:34:52 --> 02:34:54
<v MR. GRASSLEY>of spending.

4250
02:34:54 --> 02:34:56
<v MR. GRASSLEY>And don't take it from me, but

4251
02:34:56 --> 02:34:57
<v MR. GRASSLEY>it's right here in these budget

4252
02:34:57 --> 02:34:59
<v MR. GRASSLEY>documents that we've all been

4253
02:34:59 --> 02:35:01
<v MR. GRASSLEY>given this week.

4254
02:35:01 --> 02:35:02
<v MR. GRASSLEY>He's a big spender of other

4255
02:35:02 --> 02:35:04
<v MR. GRASSLEY>people's money.

4256
02:35:04 --> 02:35:08
<v MR. GRASSLEY>In dollar terms, spending goes

4257
02:35:08 --> 02:35:14
<v MR. GRASSLEY>up from $3.8 trillion this year

4258
02:35:14 --> 02:35:15
<v MR. GRASSLEY>to $5.8 trillion in 2022.

4259
02:35:15 --> 02:35:20
<v MR. GRASSLEY>over a ten-year period of time,

4260
02:35:20 --> 02:35:21
<v MR. GRASSLEY>this budget spends about $47

4261
02:35:21 --> 02:35:22
<v MR. GRASSLEY>trillion, and during that period

4262
02:35:22 --> 02:35:25
<v MR. GRASSLEY>of time increases the national

4263
02:35:25 --> 02:35:28
<v MR. GRASSLEY>debt by $11 trillion.

4264
02:35:28 --> 02:35:31
<v MR. GRASSLEY>So it's clear that this document

4265
02:35:31 --> 02:35:36
<v MR. GRASSLEY>that the President Gives to

4266
02:35:36 --> 02:35:36
<v MR. GRASSLEY>congress under law is built to

4267
02:35:36 --> 02:35:37
<v MR. GRASSLEY>spend.

4268
02:35:37 --> 02:35:39
<v MR. GRASSLEY>President Obama's budget is also

4269
02:35:39 --> 02:35:42
<v MR. GRASSLEY>harmful to our fragile economy

4270
02:35:43 --> 02:35:45
<v MR. GRASSLEY>because it would impose $1.9

4271
02:35:45 --> 02:35:47
<v MR. GRASSLEY>trillion tax dollars.

4272
02:35:47 --> 02:35:49
<v MR. GRASSLEY>And so I always go back to what

4273
02:35:49 --> 02:35:52
<v MR. GRASSLEY>I thought was a very wise

4274
02:35:52 --> 02:35:53
<v MR. GRASSLEY>decision that President Obama

4275
02:35:53 --> 02:35:55
<v MR. GRASSLEY>made about two or three weeks

4276
02:35:55 --> 02:35:56
<v MR. GRASSLEY>before he actually took the oath

4277
02:35:56 --> 02:35:58
<v MR. GRASSLEY>of office.

4278
02:35:58 --> 02:36:00
<v MR. GRASSLEY>During the campaign he reminded

4279
02:36:00 --> 02:36:02
<v MR. GRASSLEY>everybody he wants to raise

4280
02:36:02 --> 02:36:04
<v MR. GRASSLEY>taxes, but when he got to being

4281
02:36:04 --> 02:36:07
<v MR. GRASSLEY>sworn in, he looked at how bad

4282
02:36:07 --> 02:36:08
<v MR. GRASSLEY>the economy was, and he clearly

4283
02:36:08 --> 02:36:09
<v MR. GRASSLEY>said, it's not too wise to raise

4284
02:36:09 --> 02:36:12
<v MR. GRASSLEY>taxes when you're in a

4285
02:36:12 --> 02:36:13
<v MR. GRASSLEY>recession.

4286
02:36:13 --> 02:36:15
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Well, maybe technically we

4287
02:36:15 --> 02:36:18
<v MR. GRASSLEY>aren't in a recession, but for

4288
02:36:18 --> 02:36:19
<v MR. GRASSLEY>the 8.3% of the american people

4289
02:36:19 --> 02:36:22
<v MR. GRASSLEY>that are unemployed, it's not

4290
02:36:22 --> 02:36:23
<v MR. GRASSLEY>just a recession, it's also a

4291
02:36:23 --> 02:36:25
<v MR. GRASSLEY>depression forbe each

4292
02:36:25 --> 02:36:27
<v MR. GRASSLEY>for each one of them.

4293
02:36:27 --> 02:36:30
<v MR. GRASSLEY>So since the unemployment rate

4294
02:36:30 --> 02:36:32
<v MR. GRASSLEY>stands at 8.3% and the President

4295
02:36:32 --> 02:36:35
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Seems to be just fine this year

4296
02:36:35 --> 02:36:38
<v MR. GRASSLEY>compared to three years ago when

4297
02:36:38 --> 02:36:40
<v MR. GRASSLEY>he was sworn in that hiking

4298
02:36:40 --> 02:36:42
<v MR. GRASSLEY>taxes is not going to be harmful

4299
02:36:42 --> 02:36:45
<v MR. GRASSLEY>to the economy, it's not going

4300
02:36:45 --> 02:36:46
<v MR. GRASSLEY>to be harmful to those 8.3% of

4301
02:36:46 --> 02:36:48
<v MR. GRASSLEY>the people who are unemployed

4302
02:36:48 --> 02:36:51
<v MR. GRASSLEY>from finding jobs, but it is

4303
02:36:51 --> 02:36:52
<v MR. GRASSLEY>going to be.

4304
02:36:53 --> 02:36:56
<v MR. GRASSLEY>So why is the

4305
02:36:56 --> 02:36:59
<v MR. GRASSLEY>why has the president

4306
02:36:59 --> 02:37:02
<v MR. GRASSLEY>flip-flopped on this issue

4307
02:37:02 --> 02:37:04
<v MR. GRASSLEY>whether to raise taxes when you

4308
02:37:04 --> 02:37:07
<v MR. GRASSLEY>have high unemployment rates?

4309
02:37:07 --> 02:37:09
<v MR. GRASSLEY>This policy will result in fewer

4310
02:37:09 --> 02:37:09
<v MR. GRASSLEY>job opportunities particularly

4311
02:37:09 --> 02:37:15
<v MR. GRASSLEY>montana

4312
02:37:15 --> 02:37:17
<v MR. GRASSLEY>particularlyamong -- particularly among the

4313
02:37:17 --> 02:37:18
<v MR. GRASSLEY>small business people who create

4314
02:37:18 --> 02:37:18
<v MR. GRASSLEY>70% of the new jobs in our

4315
02:37:18 --> 02:37:19
<v MR. GRASSLEY>economy.

4316
02:37:19 --> 02:37:21
<v MR. GRASSLEY>That's where it's going to be

4317
02:37:21 --> 02:37:22
<v MR. GRASSLEY>really harlful.

4318
02:37:22 --> 02:37:25
<v MR. GRASSLEY>-- harmful.

4319
02:37:25 --> 02:37:27
<v MR. GRASSLEY>I recently asked federal reserve

4320
02:37:27 --> 02:37:28
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Chairman Bernanke about the

4321
02:37:29 --> 02:37:32
<v MR. GRASSLEY>prospects of a tax increase and

4322
02:37:32 --> 02:37:32
<v MR. GRASSLEY>the impact it would have on our

4323
02:37:32 --> 02:37:34
<v MR. GRASSLEY>economy.

4324
02:37:35 --> 02:37:36
<v MR. GRASSLEY>He indicated that a significant

4325
02:37:36 --> 02:37:40
<v MR. GRASSLEY>tax hike could slow the economy,

4326
02:37:40 --> 02:37:41
<v MR. GRASSLEY>slow the recovery, and in my

4327
02:37:41 --> 02:37:44
<v MR. GRASSLEY>question to him before the

4328
02:37:44 --> 02:37:45
<v MR. GRASSLEY>budget committee, I quoted the

4329
02:37:45 --> 02:37:46
<v MR. GRASSLEY>congressional budget office that

4330
02:37:46 --> 02:37:49
<v MR. GRASSLEY>said unemployment would go up

4331
02:37:49 --> 02:37:51
<v MR. GRASSLEY>and the economy would grow less

4332
02:37:51 --> 02:37:55
<v MR. GRASSLEY>if we had this big tax increase

4333
02:37:55 --> 02:37:56
<v MR. GRASSLEY>that the President Wants.

4334
02:37:56 --> 02:37:59
<v MR. GRASSLEY>The President Has spent many

4335
02:37:59 --> 02:38:01
<v MR. GRASSLEY>hours speaking about helping our

4336
02:38:01 --> 02:38:03
<v MR. GRASSLEY>economy, investing in our

4337
02:38:03 --> 02:38:06
<v MR. GRASSLEY>future, and increasing economic

4338
02:38:06 --> 02:38:10
<v MR. GRASSLEY>opportunities for all americans.

4339
02:38:10 --> 02:38:12
<v MR. GRASSLEY>While he is saying all those

4340
02:38:12 --> 02:38:13
<v MR. GRASSLEY>things that are -- that he's

4341
02:38:13 --> 02:38:14
<v MR. GRASSLEY>probably sincere about, but at

4342
02:38:14 --> 02:38:16
<v MR. GRASSLEY>the same time he doesn't hut his

4343
02:38:16 --> 02:38:18
<v MR. GRASSLEY>actions where his words are

4344
02:38:18 --> 02:38:19
<v MR. GRASSLEY>because he doesn't allow a

4345
02:38:19 --> 02:38:23
<v MR. GRASSLEY>pipeline to be built that will

4346
02:38:23 --> 02:38:24
<v MR. GRASSLEY>create 20,000 jobs right now and

4347
02:38:24 --> 02:38:27
<v MR. GRASSLEY>110,000 indirect jobs connected

4348
02:38:27 --> 02:38:30
<v MR. GRASSLEY>with it.

4349
02:38:30 --> 02:38:33
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Now, if he gets his wish to hike

4350
02:38:33 --> 02:38:36
<v MR. GRASSLEY>taxes by $1.9 trillion, it will

4351
02:38:36 --> 02:38:39
<v MR. GRASSLEY>harm all americans, further

4352
02:38:39 --> 02:38:40
<v MR. GRASSLEY>prolong this already three-year

4353
02:38:40 --> 02:38:43
<v MR. GRASSLEY>slowdown, while growing an even

4354
02:38:43 --> 02:38:45
<v MR. GRASSLEY>larger, more intrusive federal

4355
02:38:45 --> 02:38:46
<v MR. GRASSLEY>government, impinging upon

4356
02:38:46 --> 02:38:48
<v MR. GRASSLEY>personal liberties to a greater

4357
02:38:48 --> 02:38:51
<v MR. GRASSLEY>extent.

4358
02:38:51 --> 02:38:54
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Maybe the President's purpose is

4359
02:38:54 --> 02:38:55
<v MR. GRASSLEY>in -- in imposing this huge tax

4360
02:38:55 --> 02:38:57
<v MR. GRASSLEY>increase is an effort to reduce

4361
02:38:57 --> 02:38:58
<v MR. GRASSLEY>the nation's debt, and that's

4362
02:38:58 --> 02:39:00
<v MR. GRASSLEY>probably what he would tell you

4363
02:39:00 --> 02:39:01
<v MR. GRASSLEY>and he May really believe that.

4364
02:39:01 --> 02:39:03
<v MR. GRASSLEY>But, unfortunately, that's not

4365
02:39:03 --> 02:39:06
<v MR. GRASSLEY>what he has planned.

4366
02:39:06 --> 02:39:07
<v MR. GRASSLEY>He wants to spend every dollar.

4367
02:39:07 --> 02:39:10
<v MR. GRASSLEY>His budget leads to an

4368
02:39:10 --> 02:39:12
<v MR. GRASSLEY>additional, as I said before,

4369
02:39:12 --> 02:39:15
<v MR. GRASSLEY>$11 trillion increase in debt,

4370
02:39:15 --> 02:39:16
<v MR. GRASSLEY>national debt, over the next ten

4371
02:39:16 --> 02:39:20
<v MR. GRASSLEY>years, debt held by the public

4372
02:39:20 --> 02:39:23
<v MR. GRASSLEY>increases from 74% of our

4373
02:39:23 --> 02:39:25
<v MR. GRASSLEY>economy to 76% of our economy by

4374
02:39:25 --> 02:39:27
<v MR. GRASSLEY>the year 2022, at the end of

4375
02:39:27 --> 02:39:29
<v MR. GRASSLEY>this ten-year budget window.

4376
02:39:29 --> 02:39:31
<v MR. GRASSLEY>And you got to compare that to

4377
02:39:31 --> 02:39:33
<v MR. GRASSLEY>the historic average, since

4378
02:39:33 --> 02:39:35
<v MR. GRASSLEY>world war ii, and that's just

4379
02:39:35 --> 02:39:38
<v MR. GRASSLEY>43%, compared to where it is

4380
02:39:38 --> 02:39:41
<v MR. GRASSLEY>right now at 74.2%, going up to

4381
02:39:41 --> 02:39:42
<v MR. GRASSLEY>76%.

4382
02:39:42 --> 02:39:45
<v MR. GRASSLEY>If people believe that President

4383
02:39:45 --> 02:39:49
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Obama is putting us on a path to

4384
02:39:49 --> 02:39:50
<v MR. GRASSLEY>fiscal sustainability by tax

4385
02:39:50 --> 02:39:51
<v MR. GRASSLEY>increases, I'd suggest that they

4386
02:39:51 --> 02:39:53
<v MR. GRASSLEY>look at the annual deficits over

4387
02:39:53 --> 02:39:55
<v MR. GRASSLEY>the next ten years.

4388
02:39:55 --> 02:39:58
<v MR. GRASSLEY>These deficits never drop below

4389
02:39:58 --> 02:40:00
<v MR. GRASSLEY>$55 billion.

4390
02:40:00 --> 02:40:02
<v MR. GRASSLEY>-- $575 billion and actually go

4391
02:40:02 --> 02:40:06
<v MR. GRASSLEY>up toward the ends of his budget

4392
02:40:06 --> 02:40:08
<v MR. GRASSLEY>rising to $704 billion by 2022.

4393
02:40:08 --> 02:40:10
<v MR. GRASSLEY>This budget puts america on the

4394
02:40:10 --> 02:40:12
<v MR. GRASSLEY>course of deficits and debt as

4395
02:40:12 --> 02:40:14
<v MR. GRASSLEY>far as the eye can see into the

4396
02:40:14 --> 02:40:15
<v MR. GRASSLEY>future.

4397
02:40:15 --> 02:40:18
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Additionally, the President Took

4398
02:40:18 --> 02:40:20
<v MR. GRASSLEY>a pass on proposing any real

4399
02:40:20 --> 02:40:22
<v MR. GRASSLEY>changes to our entitlement

4400
02:40:22 --> 02:40:24
<v MR. GRASSLEY>programs, which are the real

4401
02:40:24 --> 02:40:26
<v MR. GRASSLEY>driver of future deficits and

4402
02:40:26 --> 02:40:26
<v MR. GRASSLEY>debt, and that's only part of

4403
02:40:26 --> 02:40:28
<v MR. GRASSLEY>it.

4404
02:40:28 --> 02:40:29
<v MR. GRASSLEY>The main part of it is, do you

4405
02:40:29 --> 02:40:31
<v MR. GRASSLEY>want to preserve social

4406
02:40:31 --> 02:40:36
<v MR. GRASSLEY>security, medicare, and medicaid

4407
02:40:36 --> 02:40:36
<v MR. GRASSLEY>for future generations, because

4408
02:40:36 --> 02:40:37
<v MR. GRASSLEY>if we don't do something about

4409
02:40:37 --> 02:40:38
<v MR. GRASSLEY>it, it is not going to be

4410
02:40:38 --> 02:40:41
<v MR. GRASSLEY>preserved.

4411
02:40:41 --> 02:40:43
<v MR. GRASSLEY>again, he's absent from the

4412
02:40:43 --> 02:40:44
<v MR. GRASSLEY>discussion when social security,

4413
02:40:44 --> 02:40:45
<v MR. GRASSLEY>medicaid, and medicare calms

4414
02:40:45 --> 02:40:46
<v MR. GRASSLEY>coms up.

4415
02:40:46 --> 02:40:48
<v MR. GRASSLEY>He's offered no solution in this

4416
02:40:48 --> 02:40:49
<v MR. GRASSLEY>budget, even though the

4417
02:40:49 --> 02:40:51
<v MR. GRASSLEY>simpson-bowles commission that

4418
02:40:51 --> 02:40:53
<v MR. GRASSLEY>he appointed, that he never

4419
02:40:53 --> 02:40:55
<v MR. GRASSLEY>endorsed their recommendations a

4420
02:40:55 --> 02:40:56
<v MR. GRASSLEY>year ago -- and why he didn't

4421
02:40:56 --> 02:40:59
<v MR. GRASSLEY>endorse and trust the people

4422
02:40:59 --> 02:41:01
<v MR. GRASSLEY>that he put in place to get a

4423
02:41:01 --> 02:41:04
<v MR. GRASSLEY>solution to these problems, i

4424
02:41:04 --> 02:41:06
<v MR. GRASSLEY>don't know -- but even the

4425
02:41:06 --> 02:41:08
<v MR. GRASSLEY>simpson-bowles commission had

4426
02:41:08 --> 02:41:10
<v MR. GRASSLEY>solutions for social security,

4427
02:41:10 --> 02:41:11
<v MR. GRASSLEY>medicare, and medicaid.

4428
02:41:11 --> 02:41:13
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Further evidence that the

4429
02:41:13 --> 02:41:17
<v MR. GRASSLEY>President Has chosen not to lead

4430
02:41:17 --> 02:41:18
<v MR. GRASSLEY>on these very, very difficult

4431
02:41:18 --> 02:41:20
<v MR. GRASSLEY>issues.

4432
02:41:20 --> 02:41:22
<v MR. GRASSLEY>President Obama has spoken a lot

4433
02:41:22 --> 02:41:23
<v MR. GRASSLEY>lately about the issue of

4434
02:41:23 --> 02:41:23
<v MR. GRASSLEY>fairness.

4435
02:41:23 --> 02:41:25
<v MR. GRASSLEY>President Obama believes that

4436
02:41:25 --> 02:41:27
<v MR. GRASSLEY>this type of budget, with higher

4437
02:41:27 --> 02:41:29
<v MR. GRASSLEY>taxes, more borrowing, and

4438
02:41:29 --> 02:41:31
<v MR. GRASSLEY>enormous deficits and debt will

4439
02:41:31 --> 02:41:33
<v MR. GRASSLEY>bring about fairness.

4440
02:41:33 --> 02:41:36
<v MR. GRASSLEY>If the President Is referring to

4441
02:41:36 --> 02:41:37
<v MR. GRASSLEY>sharing in our nation's economic

4442
02:41:37 --> 02:41:40
<v MR. GRASSLEY>decline, he's right.

4443
02:41:40 --> 02:41:43
<v MR. GRASSLEY>If he's talking about sharing in

4444
02:41:43 --> 02:41:45
<v MR. GRASSLEY>a japanese-like prolonged period

4445
02:41:45 --> 02:41:47
<v MR. GRASSLEY>of stagflation, he is right.

4446
02:41:47 --> 02:41:49
<v MR. GRASSLEY>If he's talking about sharing in

4447
02:41:49 --> 02:41:52
<v MR. GRASSLEY>an economic collapse like the

4448
02:41:52 --> 02:41:53
<v MR. GRASSLEY>one going on in greece,es

4449
02:41:53 --> 02:41:53
<v MR. GRASSLEY>, he's

4450
02:41:53 --> 02:41:56
<v MR. GRASSLEY>right.

4451
02:41:56 --> 02:41:58
<v MR. GRASSLEY>It May not be tomorrow, but all

4452
02:41:58 --> 02:42:01
<v MR. GRASSLEY>signs point down the road in

4453
02:42:01 --> 02:42:04
<v MR. GRASSLEY>those directions, because based

4454
02:42:04 --> 02:42:05
<v MR. GRASSLEY>upon the national debts of those

4455
02:42:05 --> 02:42:08
<v MR. GRASSLEY>particular countries and where

4456
02:42:08 --> 02:42:10
<v MR. GRASSLEY>we're headed.

4457
02:42:10 --> 02:42:11
<v MR. GRASSLEY>The budget proposed by President

4458
02:42:11 --> 02:42:13
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Obama will have all americans

4459
02:42:13 --> 02:42:16
<v MR. GRASSLEY>sharing in higher taxes, a

4460
02:42:16 --> 02:42:17
<v MR. GRASSLEY>larger, more untruive government

4461
02:42:17 --> 02:42:19
<v MR. GRASSLEY>-- more intrusive government,

4462
02:42:19 --> 02:42:21
<v MR. GRASSLEY>less freedom and deficits

4463
02:42:21 --> 02:42:23
<v MR. GRASSLEY>deficits and

4464
02:42:23 --> 02:42:24
<v MR. GRASSLEY>debt that will lead to economic

4465
02:42:24 --> 02:42:28
<v MR. GRASSLEY>decline for future generations.

4466
02:42:28 --> 02:42:29
<v MR. GRASSLEY>We all know that the a large

4467
02:42:29 --> 02:42:30
<v MR. GRASSLEY>deficit reduces national

4468
02:42:30 --> 02:42:31
<v MR. GRASSLEY>savings, leading to higher

4469
02:42:31 --> 02:42:33
<v MR. GRASSLEY>interest rates, more borrowing

4470
02:42:33 --> 02:42:35
<v MR. GRASSLEY>from abroad, and less domestic

4471
02:42:35 --> 02:42:36
<v MR. GRASSLEY>investment, which in turn would

4472
02:42:36 --> 02:42:38
<v MR. GRASSLEY>lower income growth in our

4473
02:42:38 --> 02:42:41
<v MR. GRASSLEY>country.

4474
02:42:41 --> 02:42:43
<v MR. GRASSLEY>This will lower middle-class --

4475
02:42:43 --> 02:42:44
<v MR. GRASSLEY>this will hurt the lower

4476
02:42:44 --> 02:42:46
<v MR. GRASSLEY>middle-class the most.

4477
02:42:46 --> 02:42:49
<v MR. GRASSLEY>The gains President Obama talks

4478
02:42:49 --> 02:42:51
<v MR. GRASSLEY>tar -- touts in his budget that

4479
02:42:51 --> 02:42:53
<v MR. GRASSLEY>he's delivering to the middle

4480
02:42:53 --> 02:42:55
<v MR. GRASSLEY>class will be dwarfed by the

4481
02:42:55 --> 02:42:59
<v MR. GRASSLEY>loss of economic activity caused

4482
02:42:59 --> 02:43:01
<v MR. GRASSLEY>by deficits and debt.

4483
02:43:01 --> 02:43:03
<v MR. GRASSLEY>This isn't a serious document.

4484
02:43:03 --> 02:43:07
<v MR. GRASSLEY>It's a political document.

4485
02:43:07 --> 02:43:09
<v MR. GRASSLEY>as evidenced by how out of touch

4486
02:43:09 --> 02:43:12
<v MR. GRASSLEY>this budget is, few of my

4487
02:43:12 --> 02:43:12
<v MR. GRASSLEY>democratic colleagues have even

4488
02:43:12 --> 02:43:14
<v MR. GRASSLEY>acknowledged that President

4489
02:43:14 --> 02:43:15
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Obama even submitted a budget,

4490
02:43:15 --> 02:43:16
<v MR. GRASSLEY>much less defended it.

4491
02:43:17 --> 02:43:18
<v MR. GRASSLEY>I hope the senate will have an

4492
02:43:18 --> 02:43:21
<v MR. GRASSLEY>opportunity to debate and vote

4493
02:43:21 --> 02:43:23
<v MR. GRASSLEY>upon President Obama's budget.

4494
02:43:23 --> 02:43:24
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Last year we had such a vote.

4495
02:43:24 --> 02:43:27
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Last year the President's budget

4496
02:43:27 --> 02:43:30
<v MR. GRASSLEY>was defeated in the senate by a

4497
02:43:30 --> 02:43:33
<v MR. GRASSLEY>vote of 97-0.

4498
02:43:33 --> 02:43:35
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Not a single member of the

4499
02:43:35 --> 02:43:35
<v MR. GRASSLEY>President's party supported his

4500
02:43:35 --> 02:43:37
<v MR. GRASSLEY>budget.

4501
02:43:37 --> 02:43:38
<v MR. GRASSLEY>So when constituents ask me why

4502
02:43:38 --> 02:43:40
<v MR. GRASSLEY>you can't doing?

4503
02:43:40 --> 02:43:42
<v MR. GRASSLEY>A bipartisan way -- why you

4504
02:43:42 --> 02:43:43
<v MR. GRASSLEY>can't do something in a

4505
02:43:43 --> 02:43:46
<v MR. GRASSLEY>bipartisan way in congress --

4506
02:43:46 --> 02:43:47
<v MR. GRASSLEY>and we do a lot that in a

4507
02:43:47 --> 02:43:48
<v MR. GRASSLEY>bipartisan way that doesn't get

4508
02:43:48 --> 02:43:50
<v MR. GRASSLEY>the attention of the prerks so

4509
02:43:50 --> 02:43:52
<v MR. GRASSLEY>people are sin -- the attention

4510
02:43:52 --> 02:43:55
<v MR. GRASSLEY>of the press, so people are

4511
02:43:55 --> 02:43:57
<v MR. GRASSLEY>cynical about congress, but I

4512
02:43:58 --> 02:44:00
<v MR. GRASSLEY>quote a 97-0 vote about whether

4513
02:44:00 --> 02:44:01
<v MR. GRASSLEY>-- or whether or not there's

4514
02:44:01 --> 02:44:02
<v MR. GRASSLEY>bipartisanship.

4515
02:44:02 --> 02:44:02
<v MR. GRASSLEY>And that's a vote against the

4516
02:44:02 --> 02:44:05
<v MR. GRASSLEY>President's budget.

4517
02:44:05 --> 02:44:07
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Every republican and every

4518
02:44:07 --> 02:44:10
<v MR. GRASSLEY>democrat agreed.

4519
02:44:10 --> 02:44:11
<v MR. GRASSLEY>I once again this year, if we

4520
02:44:11 --> 02:44:12
<v MR. GRASSLEY>ever get this to a vote, I

4521
02:44:12 --> 02:44:18
<v MR. GRASSLEY>preduct

4522
02:44:18 --> 02:44:21
<v MR. GRASSLEY>predict that very few, if any,

4523
02:44:21 --> 02:44:22
<v MR. GRASSLEY>will vote for it.

4524
02:44:22 --> 02:44:24
<v MR. GRASSLEY>It would be funny if the

4525
02:44:24 --> 02:44:25
<v MR. GRASSLEY>congresses of inaction weren't

4526
02:44:25 --> 02:44:26
<v MR. GRASSLEY>so serious.

4527
02:44:26 --> 02:44:27
<v MR. GRASSLEY>we have a moral obligation to

4528
02:44:27 --> 02:44:29
<v MR. GRASSLEY>offer serious solutions for

4529
02:44:29 --> 02:44:30
<v MR. GRASSLEY>today and for future

4530
02:44:30 --> 02:44:34
<v MR. GRASSLEY>generations.

4531
02:44:34 --> 02:44:35
<v MR. GRASSLEY>The President's budget fails in

4532
02:44:35 --> 02:44:37
<v MR. GRASSLEY>this responsibility.

4533
02:44:37 --> 02:44:39
<v MR. GRASSLEY>He has chosen a politically

4534
02:44:39 --> 02:44:42
<v MR. GRASSLEY>expedient path rather than a

4535
02:44:42 --> 02:44:44
<v MR. GRASSLEY>responsible, forthright path.

4536
02:44:44 --> 02:44:45
<v MR. GRASSLEY>Our grandchildren and

4537
02:44:45 --> 02:44:47
<v MR. GRASSLEY>great-grandchildren will suffer

4538
02:44:47 --> 02:44:49
<v MR. GRASSLEY>as a result of this failure.

4539
02:44:49 --> 02:44:50
<v MR. GRASSLEY>And that suffering comes from

4540
02:44:52 --> 02:44:54
<v THIS FACT>that for nine generations of

4541
02:44:54 --> 02:44:57
<v THIS FACT>americans, each generation --

4542
02:44:57 --> 02:44:59
<v THIS FACT>each succeeding generation has

4543
02:44:59 --> 02:45:00
<v THIS FACT>lived better than the previous

4544
02:45:00 --> 02:45:04
<v THIS FACT>generation.

4545
02:45:04 --> 02:45:06
<v THIS FACT>And a lot of americans feel that

4546
02:45:06 --> 02:45:07
<v THIS FACT>that's not going to happen with

4547
02:45:07 --> 02:45:09
<v THIS FACT>the next generation.

4548
02:45:09 --> 02:45:12
<v THIS FACT>That would be a sad commentary.

4549
02:45:12 --> 02:45:13
<v THIS FACT>I yield the floor.

4550
02:45:13 --> 02:45:14
<v THIS FACT>And I would suggest the absence

4551
02:45:14 --> 02:45:15
<v THIS FACT>of a quorum.

4552
02:45:15 --> 02:45:17
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

4553
02:45:17 --> 02:45:18
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>clerk will call the roll.

4554
02:49:13 --> 02:49:14
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

4555
02:49:14 --> 02:49:14
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senator from ohio.

4556
02:49:15 --> 02:49:15
<v MR. BROWN>thank you,

4557
02:49:15 --> 02:49:16
<v MR. BROWN>Madam President.

4558
02:49:16 --> 02:49:17
<v MR. BROWN>I ask unanimous consent to

4559
02:49:17 --> 02:49:18
<v MR. BROWN>dispense with the quorum call.

4560
02:49:18 --> 02:49:18
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

4561
02:49:18 --> 02:49:19
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

4562
02:49:22 --> 02:49:22
<v MR. BROWN>thank you,

4563
02:49:22 --> 02:49:24
<v MR. BROWN>Madam President.

4564
02:49:24 --> 02:49:25
<v MR. BROWN>I ask unanimous consent to speak

4565
02:49:25 --> 02:49:26
<v MR. BROWN>as if in morning business for up

4566
02:49:26 --> 02:49:27
<v MR. BROWN>to ten minutes.

4567
02:49:27 --> 02:49:28
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

4568
02:49:28 --> 02:49:28
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

4569
02:49:32 --> 02:49:33
<v MR. BROWN>thank you,

4570
02:49:33 --> 02:49:35
<v MR. BROWN>Madam President.

4571
02:49:35 --> 02:49:35
<v MR. BROWN>I was presiding earlier today

4572
02:49:35 --> 02:49:37
<v MR. BROWN>before the senator from north

4573
02:49:37 --> 02:49:38
<v MR. BROWN>carolina was and listened to

4574
02:49:38 --> 02:49:39
<v MR. BROWN>senator boxer talk about the

4575
02:49:39 --> 02:49:41
<v MR. BROWN>importance of this

4576
02:49:41 --> 02:49:44
<v MR. BROWN>transportation bill, this

4577
02:49:44 --> 02:49:44
<v MR. BROWN>highway bill which is, I

4578
02:49:44 --> 02:49:47
<v MR. BROWN>underscore.

4579
02:49:47 --> 02:49:49
<v MR. BROWN>I also this week, we've seen

4580
02:49:49 --> 02:49:53
<v MR. BROWN>movement on extension of the

4581
02:49:53 --> 02:49:55
<v MR. BROWN>payroll tax, tax cut and

4582
02:49:55 --> 02:49:57
<v MR. BROWN>unemployment benefits, two very

4583
02:49:57 --> 02:49:58
<v MR. BROWN>important things, with the

4584
02:49:58 --> 02:50:00
<v MR. BROWN>doctors' fix, two very important

4585
02:50:00 --> 02:50:01
<v MR. BROWN>things to keep our economy

4586
02:50:01 --> 02:50:03
<v MR. BROWN>moving.

4587
02:50:03 --> 02:50:04
<v MR. BROWN>It makes me think back what's

4588
02:50:04 --> 02:50:05
<v MR. BROWN>happened in the last couple of

4589
02:50:05 --> 02:50:07
<v MR. BROWN>years.

4590
02:50:07 --> 02:50:09
<v MR. BROWN>In 2009 when senator obama

4591
02:50:09 --> 02:50:11
<v MR. BROWN>became President Obama, we were

4592
02:50:11 --> 02:50:13
<v MR. BROWN>losing 800,000 jobs a month in

4593
02:50:13 --> 02:50:14
<v MR. BROWN>the united states of america.

4594
02:50:14 --> 02:50:15
<v MR. BROWN>800,000 jobs a month.

4595
02:50:15 --> 02:50:17
<v MR. BROWN>We know what was happening,

4596
02:50:17 --> 02:50:18
<v MR. BROWN>especially in manufacturing and

4597
02:50:18 --> 02:50:19
<v MR. BROWN>especially in states like the

4598
02:50:19 --> 02:50:21
<v MR. BROWN>presiding officer's north

4599
02:50:21 --> 02:50:25
<v MR. BROWN>carolina and my state of ohio.

4600
02:50:25 --> 02:50:27
<v MR. BROWN>In fact, we had for 12 years

4601
02:50:27 --> 02:50:31
<v MR. BROWN>every single year for 12 years,

4602
02:50:31 --> 02:50:32
<v MR. BROWN>from 1997 to 2009, we had lost

4603
02:50:32 --> 02:50:36
<v MR. BROWN>manufacturing jobs every single

4604
02:50:36 --> 02:50:37
<v MR. BROWN>year in ohio and in the united

4605
02:50:37 --> 02:50:38
<v MR. BROWN>states.

4606
02:50:38 --> 02:50:40
<v MR. BROWN>But after President Obama took

4607
02:50:40 --> 02:50:40
<v MR. BROWN>office, we passed the recovery

4608
02:50:40 --> 02:50:42
<v MR. BROWN>act.

4609
02:50:42 --> 02:50:44
<v MR. BROWN>We did some other things, the

4610
02:50:44 --> 02:50:46
<v MR. BROWN>health care bill, all that.

4611
02:50:46 --> 02:50:48
<v MR. BROWN>We've begun to see month after

4612
02:50:48 --> 02:50:49
<v MR. BROWN>month after month job growth.

4613
02:50:49 --> 02:50:51
<v MR. BROWN>Not job growth that we want yet,

4614
02:50:52 --> 02:50:52
<v MR. BROWN>not the kind of strong job

4615
02:50:52 --> 02:50:55
<v MR. BROWN>growth we want.

4616
02:50:55 --> 02:50:57
<v MR. BROWN>but for 21, 22 consecutive

4617
02:50:57 --> 02:50:58
<v MR. BROWN>months we've seen more

4618
02:50:58 --> 02:51:00
<v MR. BROWN>manufacturing jobs than the

4619
02:51:00 --> 02:51:01
<v MR. BROWN>month before, including my state

4620
02:51:01 --> 02:51:02
<v MR. BROWN>of ohio.

4621
02:51:02 --> 02:51:05
<v MR. BROWN>More manufacturing jobs every

4622
02:51:05 --> 02:51:08
<v MR. BROWN>single months than the preceding

4623
02:51:08 --> 02:51:08
<v MR. BROWN>months for 20, 21, 22 months in

4624
02:51:08 --> 02:51:09
<v MR. BROWN>a row.

4625
02:51:09 --> 02:51:11
<v MR. BROWN>Why is that?

4626
02:51:11 --> 02:51:13
<v MR. BROWN>There are a lot of reasons.

4627
02:51:13 --> 02:51:16
<v MR. BROWN>One, we began to put the economy

4628
02:51:16 --> 02:51:19
<v MR. BROWN>on track, no luting 8 -- no

4629
02:51:19 --> 02:51:19
<v MR. BROWN>longer losing 800,000 jobs a

4630
02:51:19 --> 02:51:20
<v MR. BROWN>month.

4631
02:51:20 --> 02:51:22
<v MR. BROWN>Instead gaining.

4632
02:51:22 --> 02:51:23
<v MR. BROWN>The auto rescue made a huge

4633
02:51:23 --> 02:51:25
<v MR. BROWN>difference in states like ohio

4634
02:51:25 --> 02:51:28
<v MR. BROWN>but really across the country,

4635
02:51:28 --> 02:51:28
<v MR. BROWN>as we've seen manufacturing take

4636
02:51:28 --> 02:51:30
<v MR. BROWN>off.

4637
02:51:30 --> 02:51:32
<v MR. BROWN>Coming out of every recession,

4638
02:51:32 --> 02:51:33
<v MR. BROWN>what leads us out of recession?

4639
02:51:33 --> 02:51:35
<v MR. BROWN>Typically is the auto industry.

4640
02:51:35 --> 02:51:36
<v MR. BROWN>in the midwest and throughout

4641
02:51:36 --> 02:51:39
<v MR. BROWN>the country people are making

4642
02:51:39 --> 02:51:40
<v MR. BROWN>cars, they're buying cars,

4643
02:51:40 --> 02:51:42
<v MR. BROWN>they're -- all the economic

4644
02:51:42 --> 02:51:44
<v MR. BROWN>activity generated from making a

4645
02:51:44 --> 02:51:46
<v MR. BROWN>car and buying a car and running

4646
02:51:46 --> 02:51:49
<v MR. BROWN>a car.

4647
02:51:49 --> 02:51:51
<v MR. BROWN>In one of the untold stories,

4648
02:51:51 --> 02:51:53
<v MR. BROWN>Madam President, is that in

4649
02:51:53 --> 02:51:54
<v MR. BROWN>toledo, ohio, northwest ohio,

4650
02:51:54 --> 02:51:57
<v MR. BROWN>near the michigan border, the

4651
02:51:57 --> 02:51:58
<v MR. BROWN>jeep plant, the chrysler jeep

4652
02:51:58 --> 02:52:01
<v MR. BROWN>plant, chrysler, a company saved

4653
02:52:01 --> 02:52:03
<v MR. BROWN>from the auto rescue, would have

4654
02:52:03 --> 02:52:03
<v MR. BROWN>gone into -- went into

4655
02:52:04 --> 02:52:05
<v MR. BROWN>bankruptcy.

4656
02:52:05 --> 02:52:07
<v MR. BROWN>The restructuring and the

4657
02:52:07 --> 02:52:09
<v MR. BROWN>financing by U.S. Taxpayers got

4658
02:52:09 --> 02:52:11
<v MR. BROWN>that company back on its feet,

4659
02:52:11 --> 02:52:16
<v MR. BROWN>back into business making cars.

4660
02:52:16 --> 02:52:18
<v MR. BROWN>but prior to the auto rescue, in

4661
02:52:18 --> 02:52:21
<v MR. BROWN>2008, the chrysler plant, the

4662
02:52:21 --> 02:52:23
<v MR. BROWN>jeep plant in toledo, only 50%

4663
02:52:23 --> 02:52:23
<v MR. BROWN>of the products going into a

4664
02:52:23 --> 02:52:25
<v MR. BROWN>jeep.

4665
02:52:25 --> 02:52:27
<v MR. BROWN>The components assembled in that

4666
02:52:27 --> 02:52:29
<v MR. BROWN>plant in toledo, ohio, only 50%

4667
02:52:29 --> 02:52:30
<v MR. BROWN>were american-made.

4668
02:52:30 --> 02:52:32
<v MR. BROWN>You know what happened now after

4669
02:52:32 --> 02:52:34
<v MR. BROWN>the auto rescue?

4670
02:52:34 --> 02:52:34
<v MR. BROWN>75% of those products are

4671
02:52:34 --> 02:52:35
<v MR. BROWN>american-made.

4672
02:52:35 --> 02:52:37
<v MR. BROWN>those components.

4673
02:52:37 --> 02:52:40
<v MR. BROWN>That's exactly the point.

4674
02:52:40 --> 02:52:41
<v MR. BROWN>It's not just the companies you

4675
02:52:41 --> 02:52:43
<v MR. BROWN>hear about.

4676
02:52:43 --> 02:52:44
<v MR. BROWN>Honda is a big operation in

4677
02:52:44 --> 02:52:46
<v MR. BROWN>ohio.

4678
02:52:46 --> 02:52:47
<v MR. BROWN>Chrysler, G.M., ford, all big

4679
02:52:47 --> 02:52:49
<v MR. BROWN>operations in ohio, all

4680
02:52:49 --> 02:52:52
<v MR. BROWN>expanding, all investing just in

4681
02:52:52 --> 02:52:53
<v MR. BROWN>the last six months, each of

4682
02:52:53 --> 02:52:55
<v MR. BROWN>those four companies announced

4683
02:52:55 --> 02:52:57
<v MR. BROWN>major investment dollars going

4684
02:52:57 --> 02:53:00
<v MR. BROWN>into ohio operations.

4685
02:53:00 --> 02:53:02
<v MR. BROWN>It's not just those auto plants.

4686
02:53:02 --> 02:53:04
<v MR. BROWN>It's the supply chain.

4687
02:53:04 --> 02:53:07
<v MR. BROWN>If a chrysler jeep is made out

4688
02:53:07 --> 02:53:09
<v MR. BROWN>of 75% auto parts, american

4689
02:53:09 --> 02:53:11
<v MR. BROWN>parts rather than 50% american

4690
02:53:11 --> 02:53:12
<v MR. BROWN>parts, think of the jobs that

4691
02:53:12 --> 02:53:15
<v MR. BROWN>creates.

4692
02:53:15 --> 02:53:18
<v MR. BROWN>Tires, steering wheels, locks,

4693
02:53:18 --> 02:53:20
<v MR. BROWN>transmissions, the engine, the

4694
02:53:20 --> 02:53:21
<v MR. BROWN>fenders, all the steel, all the

4695
02:53:21 --> 02:53:23
<v MR. BROWN>electronics, all the products

4696
02:53:23 --> 02:53:24
<v MR. BROWN>that go under those automobiles

4697
02:53:24 --> 02:53:26
<v MR. BROWN>and trucks.

4698
02:53:26 --> 02:53:27
<v MR. BROWN>That, Madam President, in many

4699
02:53:27 --> 02:53:30
<v MR. BROWN>ways the untold story.

4700
02:53:30 --> 02:53:31
<v MR. BROWN>The problem, though, with that

4701
02:53:31 --> 02:53:33
<v MR. BROWN>is that we're still seeing

4702
02:53:33 --> 02:53:35
<v MR. BROWN>china, the people's republic of

4703
02:53:35 --> 02:53:37
<v MR. BROWN>china, communist china cheating

4704
02:53:37 --> 02:53:41
<v MR. BROWN>when it comes to auto parts.

4705
02:53:41 --> 02:53:44
<v MR. BROWN>The auto parts trade deficit a

4706
02:53:44 --> 02:53:47
<v MR. BROWN>decade ago was about $1 billion,

4707
02:53:47 --> 02:53:50
<v MR. BROWN>meaning that the U.S. Bought --

4708
02:53:50 --> 02:53:52
<v MR. BROWN>U.S. Companies bought $1 billion

4709
02:53:52 --> 02:53:55
<v MR. BROWN>in chinese-made auto parts more

4710
02:53:55 --> 02:53:57
<v MR. BROWN>than we sold to china.

4711
02:53:57 --> 02:53:59
<v MR. BROWN>auto parts made in this country.

4712
02:53:59 --> 02:54:00
<v MR. BROWN>We had a $1 billion deficit in

4713
02:54:00 --> 02:54:04
<v MR. BROWN>auto parts.

4714
02:54:04 --> 02:54:07
<v MR. BROWN>Today that deficit is about 800%

4715
02:54:07 --> 02:54:09
<v MR. BROWN>bigger than that, around $10

4716
02:54:09 --> 02:54:10
<v MR. BROWN>billion, that auto parts trade

4717
02:54:10 --> 02:54:10
<v MR. BROWN>deficit.

4718
02:54:10 --> 02:54:13
<v MR. BROWN>Madam President, the point of

4719
02:54:13 --> 02:54:14
<v MR. BROWN>that is if we can turn that

4720
02:54:14 --> 02:54:16
<v MR. BROWN>around, if we can force the

4721
02:54:16 --> 02:54:17
<v MR. BROWN>chinese to play fair and stand

4722
02:54:17 --> 02:54:19
<v MR. BROWN>up and practice trade according

4723
02:54:19 --> 02:54:21
<v MR. BROWN>to our national interests, not

4724
02:54:21 --> 02:54:23
<v MR. BROWN>according to some economics

4725
02:54:23 --> 02:54:25
<v MR. BROWN>textbook that's 20 years out of

4726
02:54:25 --> 02:54:28
<v MR. BROWN>print, if we can do that, it

4727
02:54:28 --> 02:54:30
<v MR. BROWN>will mean way more american jobs

4728
02:54:30 --> 02:54:31
<v MR. BROWN>making auto components in steel,

4729
02:54:31 --> 02:54:34
<v MR. BROWN>in rubber and all those things

4730
02:54:34 --> 02:54:35
<v MR. BROWN>that go into creation of an

4731
02:54:35 --> 02:54:37
<v MR. BROWN>automobile, the assembly of an

4732
02:54:37 --> 02:54:40
<v MR. BROWN>automobile and a truck.

4733
02:54:40 --> 02:54:41
<v MR. BROWN>Yesterday just 100 feet from

4734
02:54:41 --> 02:54:43
<v MR. BROWN>here, a group of us met with

4735
02:54:43 --> 02:54:45
<v MR. BROWN>vice President Of china who will

4736
02:54:45 --> 02:54:47
<v MR. BROWN>soon be the leader of that

4737
02:54:47 --> 02:54:49
<v MR. BROWN>country, people predict.

4738
02:54:49 --> 02:54:49
<v MR. BROWN>The people that know china well

4739
02:54:49 --> 02:54:50
<v MR. BROWN>predict.

4740
02:54:50 --> 02:54:52
<v MR. BROWN>I asked him a question about

4741
02:54:52 --> 02:54:52
<v MR. BROWN>that, that china doesn't play

4742
02:54:52 --> 02:54:54
<v MR. BROWN>fair.

4743
02:54:54 --> 02:54:55
<v MR. BROWN>They don't play fair in

4744
02:54:55 --> 02:54:56
<v MR. BROWN>currency.

4745
02:54:56 --> 02:54:57
<v MR. BROWN>They don't play fair when it

4746
02:54:57 --> 02:55:00
<v MR. BROWN>comes to subsidizing energy and

4747
02:55:00 --> 02:55:01
<v MR. BROWN>water and capital and land.

4748
02:55:01 --> 02:55:02
<v MR. BROWN>And of course he deflected the

4749
02:55:02 --> 02:55:03
<v MR. BROWN>question.

4750
02:55:03 --> 02:55:05
<v MR. BROWN>He didn't really answer it.

4751
02:55:05 --> 02:55:07
<v MR. BROWN>I didn't expect him to.

4752
02:55:07 --> 02:55:08
<v MR. BROWN>But I wanted him to know as

4753
02:55:08 --> 02:55:10
<v MR. BROWN>eight or nine of us sitting

4754
02:55:10 --> 02:55:11
<v MR. BROWN>around the table, I was the only

4755
02:55:11 --> 02:55:15
<v MR. BROWN>one that directly brought up the

4756
02:55:15 --> 02:55:16
<v MR. BROWN>issue of trade and jobs in this

4757
02:55:16 --> 02:55:17
<v MR. BROWN>economic relationship leveling

4758
02:55:17 --> 02:55:19
<v MR. BROWN>the playing field.

4759
02:55:19 --> 02:55:21
<v MR. BROWN>that's why it is so important,

4760
02:55:21 --> 02:55:23
<v MR. BROWN>Madam President, that the house

4761
02:55:23 --> 02:55:24
<v MR. BROWN>of representatives pass my china

4762
02:55:24 --> 02:55:25
<v MR. BROWN>currency bill.

4763
02:55:25 --> 02:55:28
<v MR. BROWN>This is legislation that the

4764
02:55:28 --> 02:55:29
<v MR. BROWN>senator from north carolina has

4765
02:55:29 --> 02:55:31
<v MR. BROWN>cosponsored, senator hagan.

4766
02:55:31 --> 02:55:33
<v MR. BROWN>It's legislation that lindsey

4767
02:55:33 --> 02:55:34
<v MR. BROWN>graham from south carolina, a

4768
02:55:34 --> 02:55:35
<v MR. BROWN>republican, cosponsored.

4769
02:55:35 --> 02:55:38
<v MR. BROWN>It's legislation that chuck

4770
02:55:38 --> 02:55:41
<v MR. BROWN>schumer in new york cosponsored,

4771
02:55:41 --> 02:55:43
<v MR. BROWN>a democrat, along with olympia

4772
02:55:43 --> 02:55:44
<v MR. BROWN>snowe, a republican from maine.

4773
02:55:44 --> 02:55:46
<v MR. BROWN>And debbie stabenow, a democrat

4774
02:55:46 --> 02:55:47
<v MR. BROWN>from michigan and senator

4775
02:55:47 --> 02:55:48
<v MR. BROWN>sessions, a republican from

4776
02:55:48 --> 02:55:48
<v MR. BROWN>alabama.

4777
02:55:48 --> 02:55:50
<v MR. BROWN>All of us have come together.

4778
02:55:50 --> 02:55:52
<v MR. BROWN>It was the largest -- the

4779
02:55:52 --> 02:55:53
<v MR. BROWN>currency bill was the hrarpblest

4780
02:55:53 --> 02:55:54
<v MR. BROWN>bipartisan -- largest bipartisan

4781
02:55:54 --> 02:55:57
<v MR. BROWN>jobs bill that the united states

4782
02:55:57 --> 02:55:58
<v MR. BROWN>senate passed in 2011.

4783
02:55:58 --> 02:55:59
<v MR. BROWN>Unfortunatelily, speaker boehner

4784
02:55:59 --> 02:56:00
<v MR. BROWN>in the house of representatives

4785
02:56:00 --> 02:56:02
<v MR. BROWN>is blocking it.

4786
02:56:02 --> 02:56:02
<v MR. BROWN>It's important that he move on

4787
02:56:02 --> 02:56:05
<v MR. BROWN>that.

4788
02:56:05 --> 02:56:05
<v MR. BROWN>It will have a strong bipartisan

4789
02:56:05 --> 02:56:08
<v MR. BROWN>vote out of the house of

4790
02:56:08 --> 02:56:10
<v MR. BROWN>representatives as it did far in

4791
02:56:10 --> 02:56:11
<v MR. BROWN>excess of 60 votes in the united

4792
02:56:11 --> 02:56:12
<v MR. BROWN>states senate.

4793
02:56:12 --> 02:56:14
<v MR. BROWN>It will mean that -- it works

4794
02:56:14 --> 02:56:16
<v MR. BROWN>like this briefly.

4795
02:56:16 --> 02:56:20
<v MR. BROWN>With china cheating on currency,

4796
02:56:20 --> 02:56:24
<v MR. BROWN>intervenes a product made in

4797
02:56:24 --> 02:56:28
<v MR. BROWN>cleveland, ohio, and sold in

4798
02:56:28 --> 02:56:30
<v MR. BROWN>wuhan, china, has a 25,

4799
02:56:30 --> 02:56:31
<v MR. BROWN>minimum -- some reagan

4800
02:56:31 --> 02:56:33
<v MR. BROWN>administration former officials

4801
02:56:33 --> 02:56:35
<v MR. BROWN>say 40% or 50%.

4802
02:56:35 --> 02:56:37
<v MR. BROWN>But at least a 25% currency

4803
02:56:37 --> 02:56:39
<v MR. BROWN>tariff or tax that every one of

4804
02:56:39 --> 02:56:41
<v MR. BROWN>our products is taxed that way,

4805
02:56:41 --> 02:56:44
<v MR. BROWN>that cost is added to it when

4806
02:56:44 --> 02:56:45
<v MR. BROWN>it's sold in china.

4807
02:56:45 --> 02:56:47
<v MR. BROWN>Conversely if the chinese make

4808
02:56:47 --> 02:56:50
<v MR. BROWN>something and sell it into akron

4809
02:56:50 --> 02:56:52
<v MR. BROWN>or lima or mansfield, ohio, that

4810
02:56:52 --> 02:56:54
<v MR. BROWN>product is 25% less expensive,

4811
02:56:54 --> 02:56:55
<v MR. BROWN>which means that american

4812
02:56:55 --> 02:56:57
<v MR. BROWN>companies can't really compete.

4813
02:56:57 --> 02:56:58
<v MR. BROWN>There was a company in

4814
02:56:58 --> 02:57:00
<v MR. BROWN>brunswick -- I was talking to

4815
02:57:00 --> 02:57:00
<v MR. BROWN>two brothers that run this

4816
02:57:00 --> 02:57:02
<v MR. BROWN>company.

4817
02:57:02 --> 02:57:03
<v MR. BROWN>They were about to make a $1

4818
02:57:03 --> 02:57:05
<v MR. BROWN>million sale.

4819
02:57:05 --> 02:57:08
<v MR. BROWN>All of a sudden the chinese

4820
02:57:08 --> 02:57:11
<v MR. BROWN>competitor came in with that 25%

4821
02:57:11 --> 02:57:13
<v MR. BROWN>bonus that they get because

4822
02:57:13 --> 02:57:15
<v MR. BROWN>china games and cheats on the

4823
02:57:15 --> 02:57:16
<v MR. BROWN>currency system, they were

4824
02:57:16 --> 02:57:17
<v MR. BROWN>underpriced by 20%.

4825
02:57:17 --> 02:57:19
<v MR. BROWN>That clearly doesn't work.

4826
02:57:19 --> 02:57:20
<v MR. BROWN>That's why I said that to the

4827
02:57:20 --> 02:57:22
<v MR. BROWN>vice President Of china about

4828
02:57:22 --> 02:57:23
<v MR. BROWN>the importance of currency.

4829
02:57:23 --> 02:57:25
<v MR. BROWN>It's why the house of

4830
02:57:25 --> 02:57:25
<v MR. BROWN>representatives needs to pass my

4831
02:57:25 --> 02:57:26
<v MR. BROWN>legislation.

4832
02:57:26 --> 02:57:29
<v MR. BROWN>And it will mean that we can

4833
02:57:29 --> 02:57:32
<v MR. BROWN>keep this recovery going.

4834
02:57:32 --> 02:57:33
<v MR. BROWN>The 21 months in a row of

4835
02:57:33 --> 02:57:35
<v MR. BROWN>manufacturing job growth coupled

4836
02:57:35 --> 02:57:36
<v MR. BROWN>with the extension of the

4837
02:57:36 --> 02:57:37
<v MR. BROWN>payroll tax cut coupled with the

4838
02:57:37 --> 02:57:38
<v MR. BROWN>extension of unemployment

4839
02:57:38 --> 02:57:40
<v MR. BROWN>benefits, coupled with the

4840
02:57:40 --> 02:57:41
<v MR. BROWN>transportation bill, the highway

4841
02:57:41 --> 02:57:43
<v MR. BROWN>bill that senator boxer and

4842
02:57:43 --> 02:57:45
<v MR. BROWN>senator inhofe bipartisanly are

4843
02:57:45 --> 02:57:46
<v MR. BROWN>working on, coupled with the

4844
02:57:46 --> 02:57:48
<v MR. BROWN>china standing up to the chinese

4845
02:57:48 --> 02:57:49
<v MR. BROWN>on trade enforcement and on this

4846
02:57:49 --> 02:57:51
<v MR. BROWN>currency bill will mean we're

4847
02:57:51 --> 02:57:52
<v MR. BROWN>going to get this recovery.

4848
02:57:52 --> 02:57:54
<v MR. BROWN>We're going to sustain it.

4849
02:57:54 --> 02:57:55
<v MR. BROWN>We're going to grow it.

4850
02:57:55 --> 02:57:57
<v MR. BROWN>It's going to mean significant

4851
02:57:57 --> 02:58:00
<v MR. BROWN>new jobs in my state of ohio and

4852
02:58:00 --> 02:58:00
<v MR. BROWN>across the country.

4853
02:58:00 --> 02:58:02
<v MR. BROWN>Madam President, I yield the

4854
02:58:02 --> 02:58:03
<v MR. BROWN>floor and suggest the absence of

4855
02:58:03 --> 02:58:04
<v MR. BROWN>a quorum.

4856
02:58:04 --> 02:58:09
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

4857
02:58:09 --> 02:58:09
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>clerk will call the roll.

4858
03:45:36 --> 03:45:37
<v A SENATOR>Madam President?

4859
03:45:36 --> 03:45:40
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

4860
03:45:40 --> 03:45:40
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senator from west virginia.

4861
03:45:40 --> 03:45:44
<v A SENATOR>Madam President, I

4862
03:45:44 --> 03:45:45
<v A SENATOR>rise to speak about the --

4863
03:45:45 --> 03:45:48
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

4864
03:45:48 --> 03:45:48
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senate is in a quorum call.

4865
03:45:49 --> 03:45:49
<v MR. MANCHIN>suspend the

4866
03:45:49 --> 03:45:50
<v MR. MANCHIN>quorum call?

4867
03:45:50 --> 03:45:51
<v MR. MANCHIN>I'd like to ask unanimous

4868
03:45:51 --> 03:45:51
<v MR. MANCHIN>consent to suspend the quorum

4869
03:45:51 --> 03:45:52
<v MR. MANCHIN>call.

4870
03:45:52 --> 03:45:52
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

4871
03:45:52 --> 03:45:53
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

4872
03:45:53 --> 03:45:54
<v MR. MANCHIN>Madam President,

4873
03:45:54 --> 03:45:55
<v MR. MANCHIN>I rise today to speak about the

4874
03:45:55 --> 03:45:58
<v MR. MANCHIN>dire finances of this great

4875
03:45:58 --> 03:45:59
<v MR. MANCHIN>nation and the policies of this

4876
03:45:59 --> 03:46:00
<v MR. MANCHIN>government that are only

4877
03:46:00 --> 03:46:03
<v MR. MANCHIN>weakening our fiscal standing

4878
03:46:03 --> 03:46:06
<v MR. MANCHIN>for future generations.

4879
03:46:06 --> 03:46:08
<v MR. MANCHIN>A year ago i

4880
03:46:08 --> 03:46:08
<v MR. MANCHIN>was in a senate armed services

4881
03:46:08 --> 03:46:10
<v MR. MANCHIN>committee.

4882
03:46:10 --> 03:46:13
<v MR. MANCHIN>The then-Chairman Of the joint

4883
03:46:13 --> 03:46:14
<v MR. MANCHIN>chiefs of staff, admiral mike

4884
03:46:14 --> 03:46:16
<v MR. MANCHIN>mullen, was asked what's the

4885
03:46:16 --> 03:46:17
<v MR. MANCHIN>greatest threat to our nation's

4886
03:46:17 --> 03:46:18
<v MR. MANCHIN>and the national security.

4887
03:46:18 --> 03:46:20
<v MR. MANCHIN>I would have thought he would

4888
03:46:20 --> 03:46:22
<v MR. MANCHIN>have said terrorism, the

4889
03:46:22 --> 03:46:23
<v MR. MANCHIN>terrorists al qaeda, north

4890
03:46:23 --> 03:46:24
<v MR. MANCHIN>africa, could have been iran,

4891
03:46:24 --> 03:46:26
<v MR. MANCHIN>could have been another rising

4892
03:46:26 --> 03:46:27
<v MR. MANCHIN>military power, but he didn't

4893
03:46:27 --> 03:46:28
<v MR. MANCHIN>hesitate in responding, and he

4894
03:46:28 --> 03:46:30
<v MR. MANCHIN>said the national debt is our

4895
03:46:30 --> 03:46:32
<v MR. MANCHIN>greatest threat to this country.

4896
03:46:32 --> 03:46:34
<v MR. MANCHIN>That was one of the most

4897
03:46:34 --> 03:46:35
<v MR. MANCHIN>sobering moments I have

4898
03:46:35 --> 03:46:36
<v MR. MANCHIN>experienced since becoming a

4899
03:46:36 --> 03:46:37
<v MR. MANCHIN>united states senator.

4900
03:46:37 --> 03:46:38
<v MR. MANCHIN>I would have thought that more

4901
03:46:38 --> 03:46:40
<v MR. MANCHIN>people would hear what I heard

4902
03:46:40 --> 03:46:42
<v MR. MANCHIN>and take out the situation --

4903
03:46:42 --> 03:46:43
<v MR. MANCHIN>and take this situation more

4904
03:46:43 --> 03:46:44
<v MR. MANCHIN>seriously, but things have only

4905
03:46:44 --> 03:46:47
<v MR. MANCHIN>gotten worse since then.

4906
03:46:47 --> 03:46:49
<v MR. MANCHIN>Our debt ceiling is at a record

4907
03:46:49 --> 03:46:50
<v MR. MANCHIN>high $16.4 trillion.

4908
03:46:50 --> 03:46:52
<v MR. MANCHIN>By 2022, according to the

4909
03:46:52 --> 03:46:55
<v MR. MANCHIN>President's newly proposed

4910
03:46:55 --> 03:46:55
<v MR. MANCHIN>budget, we will be

4911
03:46:55 --> 03:46:59
<v MR. MANCHIN>$25.9 trillion in debt.

4912
03:46:59 --> 03:47:00
<v MR. MANCHIN>That means that every man, woman

4913
03:47:00 --> 03:47:03
<v MR. MANCHIN>and child will be responsible

4914
03:47:03 --> 03:47:06
<v MR. MANCHIN>for more than $79,000 of debt.

4915
03:47:06 --> 03:47:08
<v MR. MANCHIN>Our children and grandchildren

4916
03:47:08 --> 03:47:12
<v MR. MANCHIN>will be paying more in interest

4917
03:47:12 --> 03:47:14
<v MR. MANCHIN>on the debt than we spend on

4918
03:47:14 --> 03:47:17
<v MR. MANCHIN>education, energy and defense

4919
03:47:17 --> 03:47:19
<v MR. MANCHIN>combined.

4920
03:47:19 --> 03:47:20
<v MR. MANCHIN>Our elected leaders should be

4921
03:47:20 --> 03:47:21
<v MR. MANCHIN>negotiating solutions, but

4922
03:47:21 --> 03:47:22
<v MR. MANCHIN>instead everyone is cooking up

4923
03:47:22 --> 03:47:24
<v MR. MANCHIN>short-term band-aids that create

4924
03:47:24 --> 03:47:25
<v MR. MANCHIN>long-term obligations that will

4925
03:47:25 --> 03:47:26
<v MR. MANCHIN>take years for future

4926
03:47:26 --> 03:47:27
<v MR. MANCHIN>generations to repay.

4927
03:47:27 --> 03:47:30
<v MR. MANCHIN>They are trying to figure out

4928
03:47:30 --> 03:47:30
<v MR. MANCHIN>how to point fingers at the

4929
03:47:30 --> 03:47:31
<v MR. MANCHIN>other side.

4930
03:47:31 --> 03:47:33
<v MR. MANCHIN>There is not a person in west

4931
03:47:34 --> 03:47:36
<v MR. MANCHIN>virginia who can understand why

4932
03:47:36 --> 03:47:36
<v MR. MANCHIN>politics is trumping our future

4933
03:47:36 --> 03:47:38
<v MR. MANCHIN>fiscal stability.

4934
03:47:38 --> 03:47:40
<v MR. MANCHIN>I don't think there is a person

4935
03:47:40 --> 03:47:42
<v MR. MANCHIN>in america who understands why

4936
03:47:42 --> 03:47:44
<v MR. MANCHIN>in washington we can't come

4937
03:47:44 --> 03:47:46
<v MR. MANCHIN>together on a long-term fix to

4938
03:47:46 --> 03:47:49
<v MR. MANCHIN>the problems we have, and for

4939
03:47:49 --> 03:47:50
<v MR. MANCHIN>the life of me, I cannot imagine

4940
03:47:50 --> 03:47:51
<v MR. MANCHIN>why our elected leaders from

4941
03:47:51 --> 03:47:53
<v MR. MANCHIN>both sides of the aisle are

4942
03:47:53 --> 03:47:54
<v MR. MANCHIN>continuing to play political

4943
03:47:54 --> 03:47:58
<v MR. MANCHIN>football with our spending, our

4944
03:47:58 --> 03:48:01
<v MR. MANCHIN>debt and our children's future.

4945
03:48:01 --> 03:48:02
<v MR. MANCHIN>This isn't how we reach a

4946
03:48:02 --> 03:48:03
<v MR. MANCHIN>solution.

4947
03:48:03 --> 03:48:06
<v MR. MANCHIN>When I was cover of the state of

4948
03:48:06 --> 03:48:08
<v MR. MANCHIN>west virginia, I didn't blame

4949
03:48:08 --> 03:48:08
<v MR. MANCHIN>previous administrations for our

4950
03:48:08 --> 03:48:10
<v MR. MANCHIN>problems.

4951
03:48:10 --> 03:48:12
<v MR. MANCHIN>i took the responsibility for

4952
03:48:12 --> 03:48:13
<v MR. MANCHIN>fixing them, and I didn't come

4953
03:48:13 --> 03:48:13
<v MR. MANCHIN>here to blame anyone for our

4954
03:48:13 --> 03:48:15
<v MR. MANCHIN>problems either.

4955
03:48:15 --> 03:48:17
<v MR. MANCHIN>I came here to fix them.

4956
03:48:17 --> 03:48:19
<v MR. MANCHIN>I didn't come here to put the

4957
03:48:19 --> 03:48:21
<v MR. MANCHIN>next generation into more debt.

4958
03:48:21 --> 03:48:21
<v MR. MANCHIN>I came here to get them out of

4959
03:48:21 --> 03:48:25
<v MR. MANCHIN>it.

4960
03:48:25 --> 03:48:27
<v MR. MANCHIN>I came here to serve my state in

4961
03:48:27 --> 03:48:28
<v MR. MANCHIN>washington because my parents

4962
03:48:28 --> 03:48:30
<v MR. MANCHIN>and grandparents left me a

4963
03:48:30 --> 03:48:32
<v MR. MANCHIN>country that was in very sound

4964
03:48:32 --> 03:48:33
<v MR. MANCHIN>fiscal shape, and I want to do

4965
03:48:33 --> 03:48:34
<v MR. MANCHIN>the same for the next

4966
03:48:34 --> 03:48:35
<v MR. MANCHIN>generation.

4967
03:48:35 --> 03:48:37
<v MR. MANCHIN>I came here because in west

4968
03:48:37 --> 03:48:39
<v MR. MANCHIN>virginia, even during a

4969
03:48:39 --> 03:48:40
<v MR. MANCHIN>recession, we live within our

4970
03:48:40 --> 03:48:42
<v MR. MANCHIN>means and had a surplus every

4971
03:48:42 --> 03:48:43
<v MR. MANCHIN>year that I was governor.

4972
03:48:43 --> 03:48:45
<v MR. MANCHIN>The people of my state are proud

4973
03:48:45 --> 03:48:46
<v MR. MANCHIN>of what our little state

4974
03:48:46 --> 03:48:48
<v MR. MANCHIN>accomplished, and I know

4975
03:48:48 --> 03:48:50
<v MR. MANCHIN>americans can again feel that

4976
03:48:50 --> 03:48:51
<v MR. MANCHIN>same pride in this great nation

4977
03:48:51 --> 03:48:52
<v MR. MANCHIN>of ours.

4978
03:48:52 --> 03:48:54
<v MR. MANCHIN>I know that we can put our

4979
03:48:54 --> 03:48:56
<v MR. MANCHIN>fiscal house back in order.

4980
03:48:56 --> 03:48:57
<v MR. MANCHIN>I had those priorities in mind

4981
03:48:57 --> 03:48:58
<v MR. MANCHIN>when I looked at the President's

4982
03:48:58 --> 03:49:00
<v MR. MANCHIN>proposed budget.

4983
03:49:00 --> 03:49:02
<v MR. MANCHIN>The projected deficits, the

4984
03:49:02 --> 03:49:03
<v MR. MANCHIN>accumulated debt over the next

4985
03:49:03 --> 03:49:07
<v MR. MANCHIN>decade, and wondered what in the

4986
03:49:07 --> 03:49:08
<v MR. MANCHIN>world are we doing?

4987
03:49:08 --> 03:49:11
<v MR. MANCHIN>This budget claims to be

4988
03:49:11 --> 03:49:12
<v MR. MANCHIN>balanced but only if we don't

4989
03:49:12 --> 03:49:14
<v MR. MANCHIN>count the exploding interest

4990
03:49:14 --> 03:49:16
<v MR. MANCHIN>that we must pay on our

4991
03:49:16 --> 03:49:17
<v MR. MANCHIN>every-increasing debt.

4992
03:49:17 --> 03:49:20
<v MR. MANCHIN>Including interest, there is not

4993
03:49:20 --> 03:49:20
<v MR. MANCHIN>a sienl year that this budget is

4994
03:49:20 --> 03:49:21
<v MR. MANCHIN>balanced.

4995
03:49:21 --> 03:49:25
<v MR. MANCHIN>At the end of the decade, this

4996
03:49:25 --> 03:49:26
<v MR. MANCHIN>budget puts an additional

4997
03:49:26 --> 03:49:27
<v MR. MANCHIN>$6.7 trillion in -- more in

4998
03:49:27 --> 03:49:30
<v MR. MANCHIN>debt, and I would ask anybody

4999
03:49:30 --> 03:49:32
<v MR. MANCHIN>how does that make sense?

5000
03:49:32 --> 03:49:33
<v MR. MANCHIN>this is not the first time I

5001
03:49:33 --> 03:49:35
<v MR. MANCHIN>shared my concerns about this

5002
03:49:35 --> 03:49:36
<v MR. MANCHIN>country going down the wrong

5003
03:49:36 --> 03:49:38
<v MR. MANCHIN>fiscal track, and I can already

5004
03:49:38 --> 03:49:42
<v MR. MANCHIN>hear some folks saying, oh,

5005
03:49:42 --> 03:49:44
<v MR. MANCHIN>there goes joe manchin again

5006
03:49:44 --> 03:49:46
<v MR. MANCHIN>blaming President Obama.

5007
03:49:46 --> 03:49:48
<v MR. MANCHIN>Let me tell you, I'm a proud

5008
03:49:48 --> 03:49:49
<v MR. MANCHIN>democrat but I'm a proud west

5009
03:49:49 --> 03:49:50
<v MR. MANCHIN>virginian and american first,

5010
03:49:51 --> 03:49:52
<v MR. MANCHIN>and I would stand up and speak

5011
03:49:52 --> 03:49:54
<v MR. MANCHIN>my mind whether our President Is

5012
03:49:54 --> 03:49:55
<v MR. MANCHIN>a democrat or republican, and

5013
03:49:55 --> 03:49:56
<v MR. MANCHIN>I'm trying to be as

5014
03:49:56 --> 03:49:58
<v MR. MANCHIN>understanding and respectful as

5015
03:49:58 --> 03:50:01
<v MR. MANCHIN>possible in my C.I.A. Teeing,

5016
03:50:01 --> 03:50:02
<v MR. MANCHIN>but what -- in my critique, but

5017
03:50:02 --> 03:50:04
<v MR. MANCHIN>what we're doing just doesn't

5018
03:50:04 --> 03:50:06
<v MR. MANCHIN>make any census at all to me.

5019
03:50:06 --> 03:50:06
<v MR. MANCHIN>I certainly can't in good

5020
03:50:06 --> 03:50:07
<v MR. MANCHIN>conscience try to tell the

5021
03:50:07 --> 03:50:08
<v MR. MANCHIN>people of west virginia any

5022
03:50:08 --> 03:50:09
<v MR. MANCHIN>different.

5023
03:50:09 --> 03:50:11
<v MR. MANCHIN>And if we don't do anything to

5024
03:50:11 --> 03:50:12
<v MR. MANCHIN>address this fiscal mess, the

5025
03:50:12 --> 03:50:14
<v MR. MANCHIN>priorities of both democrats and

5026
03:50:14 --> 03:50:14
<v MR. MANCHIN>republicans will face the

5027
03:50:14 --> 03:50:16
<v MR. MANCHIN>consequences.

5028
03:50:16 --> 03:50:18
<v MR. MANCHIN>Standing here, I tell my

5029
03:50:18 --> 03:50:19
<v MR. MANCHIN>democratic friends that we must

5030
03:50:19 --> 03:50:21
<v MR. MANCHIN>face the truth, that the very

5031
03:50:21 --> 03:50:23
<v MR. MANCHIN>programs that we care so dearly

5032
03:50:23 --> 03:50:26
<v MR. MANCHIN>about, that we fight so hard for

5033
03:50:26 --> 03:50:28
<v MR. MANCHIN>will be destroyed unless we do

5034
03:50:28 --> 03:50:28
<v MR. MANCHIN>something about this exploding

5035
03:50:28 --> 03:50:30
<v MR. MANCHIN>debt.

5036
03:50:30 --> 03:50:31
<v MR. MANCHIN>Standing here, I also tell my

5037
03:50:31 --> 03:50:36
<v MR. MANCHIN>republican friends that they,

5038
03:50:36 --> 03:50:37
<v MR. MANCHIN>too, must face the truth and not

5039
03:50:37 --> 03:50:39
<v MR. MANCHIN>only will the programs that they

5040
03:50:39 --> 03:50:41
<v MR. MANCHIN>care about be destroyed, but

5041
03:50:41 --> 03:50:43
<v MR. MANCHIN>that they May be forced to one

5042
03:50:43 --> 03:50:44
<v MR. MANCHIN>day support a massive tax

5043
03:50:44 --> 03:50:45
<v MR. MANCHIN>increase to simply keep this

5044
03:50:45 --> 03:50:48
<v MR. MANCHIN>country solvent.

5045
03:50:48 --> 03:50:49
<v MR. MANCHIN>Both scenarios are unacceptable

5046
03:50:49 --> 03:50:51
<v MR. MANCHIN>and preventable.

5047
03:50:51 --> 03:50:53
<v MR. MANCHIN>There is a commonsense solution

5048
03:50:53 --> 03:50:55
<v MR. MANCHIN>to our nation's dire fiscal woes

5049
03:50:55 --> 03:50:59
<v MR. MANCHIN>within our grasp.

5050
03:50:59 --> 03:51:00
<v MR. MANCHIN>We already have a template with

5051
03:51:00 --> 03:51:01
<v MR. MANCHIN>substantial bipartisan support

5052
03:51:01 --> 03:51:02
<v MR. MANCHIN>split evenly between democrats

5053
03:51:02 --> 03:51:03
<v MR. MANCHIN>and republicans in both the

5054
03:51:03 --> 03:51:05
<v MR. MANCHIN>house and the senate.

5055
03:51:05 --> 03:51:07
<v MR. MANCHIN>That gives us a starting point

5056
03:51:07 --> 03:51:10
<v MR. MANCHIN>to move forward with.

5057
03:51:10 --> 03:51:11
<v MR. MANCHIN>As I have said before, the

5058
03:51:11 --> 03:51:13
<v MR. MANCHIN>bowles-simpson framework might

5059
03:51:13 --> 03:51:15
<v MR. MANCHIN>not be perfect, but it has more

5060
03:51:15 --> 03:51:16
<v MR. MANCHIN>support from both sides of the

5061
03:51:16 --> 03:51:19
<v MR. MANCHIN>aisle than anything else that I

5062
03:51:19 --> 03:51:21
<v MR. MANCHIN>have seen since I got here.

5063
03:51:21 --> 03:51:23
<v MR. MANCHIN>Not only has it withstood the

5064
03:51:23 --> 03:51:24
<v MR. MANCHIN>test of time, it has done it

5065
03:51:24 --> 03:51:25
<v MR. MANCHIN>better than any other proposal

5066
03:51:25 --> 03:51:26
<v MR. MANCHIN>I've seen.

5067
03:51:26 --> 03:51:28
<v MR. MANCHIN>It is a framework that cuts

5068
03:51:28 --> 03:51:32
<v MR. MANCHIN>trillions from our debt, makes

5069
03:51:32 --> 03:51:34
<v MR. MANCHIN>our tax system more fair and

5070
03:51:34 --> 03:51:35
<v MR. MANCHIN>raises revenue without raising

5071
03:51:35 --> 03:51:36
<v MR. MANCHIN>tax rates.

5072
03:51:36 --> 03:51:39
<v MR. MANCHIN>The only problem is that our

5073
03:51:39 --> 03:51:41
<v MR. MANCHIN>country's leaders from both

5074
03:51:41 --> 03:51:43
<v MR. MANCHIN>parties won't move forward with

5075
03:51:43 --> 03:51:44
<v MR. MANCHIN>the recommendations of the

5076
03:51:44 --> 03:51:45
<v MR. MANCHIN>bowles-simpson commission.

5077
03:51:45 --> 03:51:48
<v MR. MANCHIN>So instead of real solutions

5078
03:51:48 --> 03:51:50
<v MR. MANCHIN>where we choose our priorities,

5079
03:51:50 --> 03:51:51
<v MR. MANCHIN>based on our values, we see

5080
03:51:51 --> 03:51:53
<v MR. MANCHIN>political proposals that will

5081
03:51:53 --> 03:51:56
<v MR. MANCHIN>only send this country further

5082
03:51:56 --> 03:51:57
<v MR. MANCHIN>into a debt spiral of debt --

5083
03:51:57 --> 03:51:58
<v MR. MANCHIN>death spiral of debt.

5084
03:51:58 --> 03:52:00
<v MR. MANCHIN>Take, for example, the fact that

5085
03:52:00 --> 03:52:02
<v MR. MANCHIN>this body will soon debate

5086
03:52:02 --> 03:52:03
<v MR. MANCHIN>extending the so-called payroll

5087
03:52:03 --> 03:52:05
<v MR. MANCHIN>tax cut for the remainder of

5088
03:52:05 --> 03:52:07
<v MR. MANCHIN>this year, ten more months.

5089
03:52:07 --> 03:52:07
<v MR. MANCHIN>Let's call that what it really

5090
03:52:07 --> 03:52:08
<v MR. MANCHIN>is.

5091
03:52:08 --> 03:52:11
<v MR. MANCHIN>It truly is cutting funding to

5092
03:52:11 --> 03:52:12
<v MR. MANCHIN>social security.

5093
03:52:12 --> 03:52:14
<v MR. MANCHIN>This congress has voted twice

5094
03:52:14 --> 03:52:15
<v MR. MANCHIN>since I have been here to tell

5095
03:52:15 --> 03:52:17
<v MR. MANCHIN>americans that they don't have

5096
03:52:17 --> 03:52:18
<v MR. MANCHIN>to pay their share as far as the

5097
03:52:18 --> 03:52:20
<v MR. MANCHIN>obligation to social security.

5098
03:52:20 --> 03:52:22
<v MR. MANCHIN>I voted for the idea the first

5099
03:52:22 --> 03:52:25
<v MR. MANCHIN>time around because I thought as

5100
03:52:25 --> 03:52:26
<v MR. MANCHIN>it was proposed to me that it

5101
03:52:26 --> 03:52:28
<v MR. MANCHIN>might preet more jobs or save

5102
03:52:28 --> 03:52:30
<v MR. MANCHIN>jobs, but I don't think that we

5103
03:52:30 --> 03:52:31
<v MR. MANCHIN>have seen much evidence that

5104
03:52:31 --> 03:52:33
<v MR. MANCHIN>that's happened, and so I

5105
03:52:33 --> 03:52:35
<v MR. MANCHIN>decided to stop throwing good

5106
03:52:35 --> 03:52:37
<v MR. MANCHIN>money after bad and stop

5107
03:52:37 --> 03:52:39
<v MR. MANCHIN>jeopardizing social security.

5108
03:52:39 --> 03:52:41
<v MR. MANCHIN>But as I warned this fall along

5109
03:52:41 --> 03:52:43
<v MR. MANCHIN>with my dear friend, senator

5110
03:52:43 --> 03:52:45
<v MR. MANCHIN>mark kirk, who all our prayers

5111
03:52:45 --> 03:52:47
<v MR. MANCHIN>are with, and now we talk about

5112
03:52:47 --> 03:52:49
<v MR. MANCHIN>extending this policy

5113
03:52:49 --> 03:52:51
<v MR. MANCHIN>indefinitely, because once

5114
03:52:51 --> 03:52:53
<v MR. MANCHIN>something like this is enacted,

5115
03:52:53 --> 03:52:53
<v MR. MANCHIN>even an active congress can't

5116
03:52:53 --> 03:52:55
<v MR. MANCHIN>reverse it.

5117
03:52:55 --> 03:52:56
<v MR. MANCHIN>it might only take an act of God

5118
03:52:56 --> 03:52:58
<v MR. MANCHIN>to reverse it.

5119
03:52:58 --> 03:52:59
<v MR. MANCHIN>Now, I know that going back home

5120
03:52:59 --> 03:53:00
<v MR. MANCHIN>and saying we voted for tax cuts

5121
03:53:00 --> 03:53:01
<v MR. MANCHIN>is popular.

5122
03:53:01 --> 03:53:03
<v MR. MANCHIN>Everybody wants to be popular in

5123
03:53:03 --> 03:53:03
<v MR. MANCHIN>this arena, but this is not a

5124
03:53:03 --> 03:53:07
<v MR. MANCHIN>tax cut.

5125
03:53:07 --> 03:53:08
<v MR. MANCHIN>This is a social security cut.

5126
03:53:08 --> 03:53:10
<v MR. MANCHIN>Plain and simple, and you cannot

5127
03:53:10 --> 03:53:15
<v MR. MANCHIN>make it look any different.

5128
03:53:15 --> 03:53:17
<v MR. MANCHIN>and knowing that we're adding

5129
03:53:17 --> 03:53:20
<v MR. MANCHIN>10,000, 10,000 beneficiaries

5130
03:53:20 --> 03:53:23
<v MR. MANCHIN>turning 65 years of age every

5131
03:53:23 --> 03:53:24
<v MR. MANCHIN>day, and when you look at last

5132
03:53:24 --> 03:53:28
<v MR. MANCHIN>year, social security was the

5133
03:53:28 --> 03:53:29
<v MR. MANCHIN>first time that we paid out more

5134
03:53:29 --> 03:53:32
<v MR. MANCHIN>than we took in.

5135
03:53:32 --> 03:53:32
<v MR. MANCHIN>That doesn't make any sense.

5136
03:53:32 --> 03:53:35
<v MR. MANCHIN>Just what exactly will

5137
03:53:35 --> 03:53:37
<v MR. MANCHIN>continuing this policy do to the

5138
03:53:37 --> 03:53:37
<v MR. MANCHIN>long-term solvency of social

5139
03:53:37 --> 03:53:40
<v MR. MANCHIN>security?

5140
03:53:40 --> 03:53:42
<v MR. MANCHIN>The answer is really simple.

5141
03:53:42 --> 03:53:44
<v MR. MANCHIN>It will be a disaster.

5142
03:53:44 --> 03:53:46
<v MR. MANCHIN>Now, the so-called experts will

5143
03:53:46 --> 03:53:48
<v MR. MANCHIN>tell you that everything will be

5144
03:53:48 --> 03:53:49
<v MR. MANCHIN>right because we'll backfill

5145
03:53:49 --> 03:53:50
<v MR. MANCHIN>those contributions with revenue

5146
03:53:50 --> 03:53:52
<v MR. MANCHIN>from our general fund.

5147
03:53:52 --> 03:53:53
<v MR. MANCHIN>Let me remind you that this is

5148
03:53:53 --> 03:53:54
<v MR. MANCHIN>the fourth straight year that

5149
03:53:54 --> 03:53:58
<v MR. MANCHIN>the general fund has operated

5150
03:53:58 --> 03:53:59
<v MR. MANCHIN>with a deficit of more than more

5151
03:53:59 --> 03:54:00
<v MR. MANCHIN>than $4 trillion.

5152
03:54:00 --> 03:54:02
<v MR. MANCHIN>That has never happened in the

5153
03:54:02 --> 03:54:05
<v MR. MANCHIN>life of this great country.

5154
03:54:05 --> 03:54:07
<v MR. MANCHIN>We have accumulateed

5155
03:54:07 --> 03:54:09
<v MR. MANCHIN>$15.36 trillion of debt as of

5156
03:54:09 --> 03:54:13
<v MR. MANCHIN>today, and the President Just

5157
03:54:13 --> 03:54:15
<v MR. MANCHIN>allowed that to grow to

5158
03:54:15 --> 03:54:15
<v MR. MANCHIN>$16.4 trillion with a new debt

5159
03:54:15 --> 03:54:16
<v MR. MANCHIN>ceiling.

5160
03:54:16 --> 03:54:18
<v MR. MANCHIN>The same experts who tell us

5161
03:54:18 --> 03:54:20
<v MR. MANCHIN>that we can balance a budget if

5162
03:54:20 --> 03:54:21
<v MR. MANCHIN>we simply ignore the

5163
03:54:21 --> 03:54:23
<v MR. MANCHIN>fundamentals of math, now, does

5164
03:54:23 --> 03:54:27
<v MR. MANCHIN>that make sense?

5165
03:54:27 --> 03:54:31
<v MR. MANCHIN>Madam President, when this body

5166
03:54:31 --> 03:54:32
<v MR. MANCHIN>votes on whether to extend the

5167
03:54:32 --> 03:54:34
<v MR. MANCHIN>so-called payroll tax cut or as

5168
03:54:34 --> 03:54:35
<v MR. MANCHIN>it should be more accurately

5169
03:54:35 --> 03:54:36
<v MR. MANCHIN>described the funding of social

5170
03:54:36 --> 03:54:38
<v MR. MANCHIN>security's revenue stream, I

5171
03:54:38 --> 03:54:39
<v MR. MANCHIN>cannot in good conscience vote

5172
03:54:39 --> 03:54:40
<v MR. MANCHIN>to undermine social security.

5173
03:54:40 --> 03:54:41
<v MR. MANCHIN>I have taken this position

5174
03:54:41 --> 03:54:43
<v MR. MANCHIN>because at the end of the day,

5175
03:54:43 --> 03:54:47
<v MR. MANCHIN>the people of west virginia and

5176
03:54:47 --> 03:54:47
<v MR. MANCHIN>this nation must be told the

5177
03:54:47 --> 03:54:49
<v MR. MANCHIN>truth.

5178
03:54:49 --> 03:54:50
<v MR. MANCHIN>Which is why the budget proposal

5179
03:54:50 --> 03:54:52
<v MR. MANCHIN>the President Offered this week

5180
03:54:52 --> 03:54:52
<v MR. MANCHIN>is so disappointing and

5181
03:54:52 --> 03:54:55
<v MR. MANCHIN>maddening.

5182
03:54:55 --> 03:54:55
<v MR. MANCHIN>Now, let's be clear.

5183
03:54:55 --> 03:54:58
<v MR. MANCHIN>Both republicans and democrats

5184
03:54:58 --> 03:54:58
<v MR. MANCHIN>are responsible for our budget

5185
03:54:58 --> 03:55:00
<v MR. MANCHIN>problems.

5186
03:55:00 --> 03:55:01
<v MR. MANCHIN>Everybody, everybody is

5187
03:55:01 --> 03:55:04
<v MR. MANCHIN>responsible where we are today.

5188
03:55:05 --> 03:55:07
<v MR. MANCHIN>In fairness, this administration

5189
03:55:07 --> 03:55:09
<v MR. MANCHIN>inherited a tremendous debt.

5190
03:55:09 --> 03:55:10
<v MR. MANCHIN>Falling revenues and a terrible

5191
03:55:10 --> 03:55:12
<v MR. MANCHIN>economy.

5192
03:55:12 --> 03:55:15
<v MR. MANCHIN>Everyone was at fault, and the

5193
03:55:15 --> 03:55:17
<v MR. MANCHIN>public spoke loud and clear,

5194
03:55:17 --> 03:55:19
<v MR. MANCHIN>they changed things with the

5195
03:55:19 --> 03:55:21
<v MR. MANCHIN>2008 election and they said fix

5196
03:55:21 --> 03:55:22
<v MR. MANCHIN>it, but we haven't done it, and

5197
03:55:22 --> 03:55:22
<v MR. MANCHIN>this budget doesn't do it

5198
03:55:22 --> 03:55:24
<v MR. MANCHIN>either.

5199
03:55:24 --> 03:55:26
<v MR. MANCHIN>If we are going to address our

5200
03:55:26 --> 03:55:29
<v MR. MANCHIN>fiscal nightmare and stop

5201
03:55:29 --> 03:55:30
<v MR. MANCHIN>digging a deeper debt owed, we

5202
03:55:30 --> 03:55:31
<v MR. MANCHIN>must have a meaningful tax

5203
03:55:31 --> 03:55:33
<v MR. MANCHIN>reform that not only ensures

5204
03:55:33 --> 03:55:35
<v MR. MANCHIN>that everybody pays their fair

5205
03:55:35 --> 03:55:38
<v MR. MANCHIN>share but that also strengthens

5206
03:55:38 --> 03:55:39
<v MR. MANCHIN>our economy and creates jobs,

5207
03:55:39 --> 03:55:41
<v MR. MANCHIN>good jobs.

5208
03:55:41 --> 03:55:44
<v MR. MANCHIN>Instead, this budget is not

5209
03:55:44 --> 03:55:45
<v MR. MANCHIN>balanced even once over the next

5210
03:55:45 --> 03:55:47
<v MR. MANCHIN>decade.

5211
03:55:47 --> 03:55:50
<v MR. MANCHIN>It would actually add an

5212
03:55:50 --> 03:55:53
<v MR. MANCHIN>additional $6.7 trillion of more

5213
03:55:53 --> 03:55:55
<v MR. MANCHIN>debt on top of the

5214
03:55:55 --> 03:55:57
<v MR. MANCHIN>$16.4 trillion debt ceiling that

5215
03:55:57 --> 03:55:58
<v MR. MANCHIN>we have now that the President

5216
03:55:58 --> 03:56:01
<v MR. MANCHIN>Just authorized.

5217
03:56:01 --> 03:56:03
<v MR. MANCHIN>That's more than $23 trillion of

5218
03:56:03 --> 03:56:05
<v MR. MANCHIN>debt by 2022.

5219
03:56:05 --> 03:56:07
<v MR. MANCHIN>That is simply unsustainable.

5220
03:56:07 --> 03:56:09
<v MR. MANCHIN>This proposed budget relies too

5221
03:56:09 --> 03:56:11
<v MR. MANCHIN>much on famine accounting from

5222
03:56:11 --> 03:56:13
<v MR. MANCHIN>the so-called war savings from a

5223
03:56:13 --> 03:56:15
<v MR. MANCHIN>war that should have been over

5224
03:56:15 --> 03:56:16
<v MR. MANCHIN>when its purpose changed to what

5225
03:56:17 --> 03:56:19
<v MR. MANCHIN>I call nation building.

5226
03:56:19 --> 03:56:20
<v MR. MANCHIN>in terms of energy investment,

5227
03:56:20 --> 03:56:23
<v MR. MANCHIN>one area that business and labor

5228
03:56:23 --> 03:56:24
<v MR. MANCHIN>both believe is critical to not

5229
03:56:24 --> 03:56:26
<v MR. MANCHIN>only creating more jobs but

5230
03:56:26 --> 03:56:27
<v MR. MANCHIN>keeping the good jobs that we

5231
03:56:27 --> 03:56:29
<v MR. MANCHIN>have, this administration

5232
03:56:29 --> 03:56:30
<v MR. MANCHIN>continues to pick winners and

5233
03:56:30 --> 03:56:33
<v MR. MANCHIN>losers.

5234
03:56:33 --> 03:56:34
<v MR. MANCHIN>Take the role of coal, for

5235
03:56:34 --> 03:56:35
<v MR. MANCHIN>example.

5236
03:56:35 --> 03:56:37
<v MR. MANCHIN>As I just pointed out in the

5237
03:56:37 --> 03:56:38
<v MR. MANCHIN>energy natural resources

5238
03:56:38 --> 03:56:39
<v MR. MANCHIN>committee, the dismings' own

5239
03:56:39 --> 03:56:41
<v MR. MANCHIN>department of energy forecast,

5240
03:56:41 --> 03:56:45
<v MR. MANCHIN>that coal will play a major role

5241
03:56:45 --> 03:56:48
<v MR. MANCHIN>in the energy portfolio well

5242
03:56:48 --> 03:56:50
<v MR. MANCHIN>into the coming decades, up to

5243
03:56:50 --> 03:56:51
<v MR. MANCHIN>2035, but this budget slashes

5244
03:56:51 --> 03:56:53
<v MR. MANCHIN>funding for the research that

5245
03:56:53 --> 03:56:55
<v MR. MANCHIN>would allow us to use coal more

5246
03:56:55 --> 03:56:56
<v MR. MANCHIN>efficiently and more cleanly

5247
03:56:56 --> 03:56:59
<v MR. MANCHIN>with environmental standards

5248
03:56:59 --> 03:57:01
<v MR. MANCHIN>that we must be responsible for.

5249
03:57:01 --> 03:57:03
<v MR. MANCHIN>Madam President, this doesn't

5250
03:57:03 --> 03:57:04
<v MR. MANCHIN>make sense, and it puts the

5251
03:57:04 --> 03:57:08
<v MR. MANCHIN>livelihoods of an awful lot of

5252
03:57:08 --> 03:57:10
<v MR. MANCHIN>west virginiaians and

5253
03:57:10 --> 03:57:11
<v MR. MANCHIN>americans west virginians and

5254
03:57:11 --> 03:57:12
<v MR. MANCHIN>americans in jeopardy.

5255
03:57:12 --> 03:57:14
<v MR. MANCHIN>This defies commonsense

5256
03:57:14 --> 03:57:16
<v MR. MANCHIN>especially when millions of

5257
03:57:16 --> 03:57:18
<v MR. MANCHIN>americans rely on coal for their

5258
03:57:18 --> 03:57:20
<v MR. MANCHIN>jobs and also the affordable and

5259
03:57:20 --> 03:57:20
<v MR. MANCHIN>reliable electricity that it

5260
03:57:20 --> 03:57:21
<v MR. MANCHIN>produces.

5261
03:57:21 --> 03:57:23
<v MR. MANCHIN>We're spending more where we

5262
03:57:23 --> 03:57:23
<v MR. MANCHIN>don't need to and less where we

5263
03:57:23 --> 03:57:24
<v MR. MANCHIN>do.

5264
03:57:24 --> 03:57:25
<v MR. MANCHIN>We're extending programs that do

5265
03:57:25 --> 03:57:26
<v MR. MANCHIN>not work and going into debt to

5266
03:57:26 --> 03:57:28
<v MR. MANCHIN>pay for them.

5267
03:57:28 --> 03:57:30
<v MR. MANCHIN>And then we wonder why this

5268
03:57:30 --> 03:57:31
<v MR. MANCHIN>great nation faces such a dire

5269
03:57:31 --> 03:57:33
<v MR. MANCHIN>fiscal future.

5270
03:57:33 --> 03:57:35
<v MR. MANCHIN>So if and when the President's

5271
03:57:35 --> 03:57:37
<v MR. MANCHIN>budget proposal comes up for a

5272
03:57:37 --> 03:57:38
<v MR. MANCHIN>vote, I simply cannot support

5273
03:57:38 --> 03:57:39
<v MR. MANCHIN>it.

5274
03:57:39 --> 03:57:40
<v MR. MANCHIN>as always, though, I will

5275
03:57:40 --> 03:57:42
<v MR. MANCHIN>continue to work diligently with

5276
03:57:42 --> 03:57:45
<v MR. MANCHIN>my colleagues on both sides of

5277
03:57:45 --> 03:57:46
<v MR. MANCHIN>the aisle to push for a more

5278
03:57:46 --> 03:57:48
<v MR. MANCHIN>commonsense fiscal approach

5279
03:57:48 --> 03:57:49
<v MR. MANCHIN>based on the bipartisan

5280
03:57:49 --> 03:57:51
<v MR. MANCHIN>bowles-simpson template so we

5281
03:57:51 --> 03:57:53
<v MR. MANCHIN>can finally and responsibly

5282
03:57:53 --> 03:57:56
<v MR. MANCHIN>address the fiscal problems our

5283
03:57:56 --> 03:57:57
<v MR. MANCHIN>nation and our families face.

5284
03:57:57 --> 03:58:00
<v MR. MANCHIN>And I urge the President And my

5285
03:58:00 --> 03:58:01
<v MR. MANCHIN>colleagues to do the same.

5286
03:58:01 --> 03:58:03
<v MR. MANCHIN>Madam President, allow me to

5287
03:58:03 --> 03:58:05
<v MR. MANCHIN>close by saying that I do travel

5288
03:58:05 --> 03:58:06
<v MR. MANCHIN>my state, like most of my

5289
03:58:06 --> 03:58:07
<v MR. MANCHIN>colleagues, and I'm sure that

5290
03:58:07 --> 03:58:09
<v MR. MANCHIN>you do in missouri.

5291
03:58:09 --> 03:58:11
<v MR. MANCHIN>I meet with my constituents like

5292
03:58:11 --> 03:58:12
<v MR. MANCHIN>you do also, and I can tell you

5293
03:58:12 --> 03:58:14
<v MR. MANCHIN>what I find out from them.

5294
03:58:14 --> 03:58:16
<v MR. MANCHIN>There are a lot of issues that

5295
03:58:16 --> 03:58:18
<v MR. MANCHIN>they are worried about.

5296
03:58:18 --> 03:58:20
<v MR. MANCHIN>There are some places where they

5297
03:58:20 --> 03:58:22
<v MR. MANCHIN>disagree, but there is one issue

5298
03:58:22 --> 03:58:24
<v MR. MANCHIN>that gets universal agreement

5299
03:58:24 --> 03:58:25
<v MR. MANCHIN>and brings everybody together.

5300
03:58:25 --> 03:58:27
<v MR. MANCHIN>When they tell us to a person

5301
03:58:27 --> 03:58:28
<v MR. MANCHIN>they are concerned that those of

5302
03:58:28 --> 03:58:29
<v MR. MANCHIN>us in washington aren't

5303
03:58:29 --> 03:58:31
<v MR. MANCHIN>listening to their cries to put

5304
03:58:31 --> 03:58:31
<v MR. MANCHIN>the country ahead of our

5305
03:58:32 --> 03:58:33
<v MR. MANCHIN>politics.

5306
03:58:33 --> 03:58:34
<v MR. MANCHIN>They urge all of us to stand up

5307
03:58:34 --> 03:58:35
<v MR. MANCHIN>and do what is right for this

5308
03:58:35 --> 03:58:37
<v MR. MANCHIN>country.

5309
03:58:37 --> 03:58:39
<v MR. MANCHIN>We must not let selfish

5310
03:58:39 --> 03:58:41
<v MR. MANCHIN>ambitions about the next

5311
03:58:41 --> 03:58:43
<v MR. MANCHIN>election cloud what must be done

5312
03:58:43 --> 03:58:45
<v MR. MANCHIN>for the nation that I know that

5313
03:58:45 --> 03:58:46
<v MR. MANCHIN>we all love.

5314
03:58:46 --> 03:58:47
<v MR. MANCHIN>The challenge before us is a

5315
03:58:47 --> 03:58:49
<v MR. MANCHIN>simple one.

5316
03:58:49 --> 03:58:51
<v MR. MANCHIN>Over the course of our history,

5317
03:58:51 --> 03:58:53
<v MR. MANCHIN>this nation has succeeded

5318
03:58:53 --> 03:58:56
<v MR. MANCHIN>because our parents and

5319
03:58:56 --> 03:58:57
<v MR. MANCHIN>grandparents left our country

5320
03:58:57 --> 03:59:00
<v MR. MANCHIN>better off than what they

5321
03:59:00 --> 03:59:00
<v MR. MANCHIN>inherited from their parents and

5322
03:59:00 --> 03:59:02
<v MR. MANCHIN>grandparents.

5323
03:59:02 --> 03:59:05
<v MR. MANCHIN>Madam President, we can't be the

5324
03:59:05 --> 03:59:06
<v MR. MANCHIN>first generation to fail to

5325
03:59:06 --> 03:59:08
<v MR. MANCHIN>leave the united states in

5326
03:59:08 --> 03:59:09
<v MR. MANCHIN>better shape for the next

5327
03:59:09 --> 03:59:10
<v MR. MANCHIN>generation.

5328
03:59:10 --> 03:59:10
<v MR. MANCHIN>I don't want to be a part of

5329
03:59:10 --> 03:59:13
<v MR. MANCHIN>that.

5330
03:59:13 --> 03:59:15
<v MR. MANCHIN>I do not intend to stand by and

5331
03:59:15 --> 03:59:17
<v MR. MANCHIN>let a party or politics destroy

5332
03:59:17 --> 03:59:19
<v MR. MANCHIN>the hopes of the next generation

5333
03:59:19 --> 03:59:21
<v MR. MANCHIN>for this great country, and i

5334
03:59:21 --> 03:59:23
<v MR. MANCHIN>urge all of our congressional

5335
03:59:23 --> 03:59:26
<v MR. MANCHIN>leaders and our President To put

5336
03:59:26 --> 03:59:27
<v MR. MANCHIN>politics aside and realize one

5337
03:59:27 --> 03:59:30
<v MR. MANCHIN>simple fact -- whether we are

5338
03:59:30 --> 03:59:32
<v MR. MANCHIN>democrats or republicans or

5339
03:59:32 --> 03:59:35
<v MR. MANCHIN>independents, we all belong to

5340
03:59:35 --> 03:59:36
<v MR. MANCHIN>the same party, and that party

5341
03:59:36 --> 03:59:38
<v MR. MANCHIN>is called america and we will

5342
03:59:38 --> 03:59:40
<v MR. MANCHIN>rise or fall together.

5343
03:59:40 --> 03:59:41
<v MR. MANCHIN>Thank you, Madam President, and

5344
03:59:42 --> 03:59:42
<v MR. MANCHIN>i yield the floor and I notice

5345
03:59:42 --> 03:59:43
<v MR. MANCHIN>the absence of a quorum.

5346
03:59:43 --> 03:59:47
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the clerk

5347
03:59:47 --> 03:59:48
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>will call the roll.

5348
04:15:38 --> 04:15:39
<v A SENATOR>Mr. President.

5349
04:15:39 --> 04:15:41
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

5350
04:15:41 --> 04:15:42
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senator from new hampshire.

5351
04:15:43 --> 04:15:44
<v A SENATOR>I ask that the quorum

5352
04:15:44 --> 04:15:45
<v A SENATOR>call be lifted.

5353
04:15:45 --> 04:15:50
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

5354
04:15:50 --> 04:15:51
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

5355
04:15:52 --> 04:15:55
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>Mr. President, we

5356
04:15:55 --> 04:15:56
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>voted 85-11 to start work on the

5357
04:15:56 --> 04:15:57
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>highway bill which is an

5358
04:15:57 --> 04:15:59
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>essential piece of legislation

5359
04:15:59 --> 04:16:02
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>to reauthorize our highway and

5360
04:16:02 --> 04:16:05
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>transit programs.

5361
04:16:05 --> 04:16:07
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>868 days have passed since our

5362
04:16:07 --> 04:16:09
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>last federal transportation bill

5363
04:16:09 --> 04:16:13
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>expired, and if you can't do

5364
04:16:13 --> 04:16:17
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>the math very fast, just to put

5365
04:16:17 --> 04:16:20
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>a little more emphasis on that,

5366
04:16:20 --> 04:16:22
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>that's two years, four months,

5367
04:16:22 --> 04:16:24
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>and 18 days since the last

5368
04:16:24 --> 04:16:25
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>federal transportation bill

5369
04:16:25 --> 04:16:28
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>expired.

5370
04:16:28 --> 04:16:29
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>We need new legislation to help

5371
04:16:29 --> 04:16:32
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>streamline federal programs,

5372
04:16:32 --> 04:16:33
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>spur job creation, and move our

5373
04:16:33 --> 04:16:37
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>transportation system into the

5374
04:16:37 --> 04:16:39
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>21st century.

5375
04:16:39 --> 04:16:42
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>This transportation bill before

5376
04:16:42 --> 04:16:45
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>us is about infrastructure and

5377
04:16:45 --> 04:16:48
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>we call it infrastructure

5378
04:16:48 --> 04:16:51
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>because infra means &quot;below,&quot; so

5379
04:16:51 --> 04:16:54
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>it is the foundation beneath

5380
04:16:54 --> 04:16:56
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>which everything else about our

5381
04:16:56 --> 04:17:00
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>civilized country is built as we

5382
04:17:00 --> 04:17:02
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>think about the buildings and

5383
04:17:02 --> 04:17:05
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>operating our municipalities and

5384
04:17:05 --> 04:17:06
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>our states and our federal

5385
04:17:06 --> 04:17:07
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>government, our country.

5386
04:17:07 --> 04:17:10
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>It's about making sure that we

5387
04:17:10 --> 04:17:13
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>have a sound infrastructure.

5388
04:17:13 --> 04:17:16
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>Our businesses, our workers, our

5389
04:17:16 --> 04:17:17
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>innovators, all of them rely on

5390
04:17:17 --> 04:17:18
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>a system of quality

5391
04:17:18 --> 04:17:20
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>infrastructure to succeed.

5392
04:17:20 --> 04:17:25
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>More funding for transportation

5393
04:17:25 --> 04:17:26
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>in this bill means we can do

5394
04:17:26 --> 04:17:30
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>critical roads and bridges, we

5395
04:17:30 --> 04:17:30
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>can do repairs to the existing

5396
04:17:30 --> 04:17:33
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>roads and bridges.

5397
04:17:33 --> 04:17:38
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>It means we have more transit

5398
04:17:38 --> 04:17:39
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>for buses and railroads, and

5399
04:17:39 --> 04:17:40
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>that means we can put people

5400
04:17:40 --> 04:17:41
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>back to work.

5401
04:17:41 --> 04:17:44
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>More jobs for construction and

5402
04:17:44 --> 04:17:46
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>manufacturing workers, more jobs

5403
04:17:46 --> 04:17:48
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>for workers means more consumer

5404
04:17:48 --> 04:17:49
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>spending and a stronger overall

5405
04:17:49 --> 04:17:50
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>economy.

5406
04:17:50 --> 04:17:53
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>The federal highway

5407
04:17:53 --> 04:17:55
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>administration estimates that

5408
04:17:55 --> 04:17:59
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>for every $1 billion that we

5409
04:17:59 --> 04:18:03
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>spend on highways, that spending

5410
04:18:03 --> 04:18:04
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>supports more than 27,000 jobs.

5411
04:18:04 --> 04:18:06
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>And economists at moody's

5412
04:18:06 --> 04:18:08
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>estimate that for every dollar

5413
04:18:08 --> 04:18:09
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>that we invest in

5414
04:18:09 --> 04:18:11
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>infrastructure, our gross

5415
04:18:11 --> 04:18:11
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>domestic product goes up by

5416
04:18:11 --> 04:18:12
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>$1.59.

5417
04:18:12 --> 04:18:14
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>That's because of the ripple

5418
04:18:14 --> 04:18:17
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>effect that those investments

5419
04:18:17 --> 04:18:20
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>have in our economy.

5420
04:18:20 --> 04:18:22
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>The bill before us would help

5421
04:18:22 --> 04:18:24
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>create about a million american

5422
04:18:24 --> 04:18:25
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>jobs, many of them in the

5423
04:18:25 --> 04:18:27
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>construction industry, which has

5424
04:18:27 --> 04:18:30
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>been one of the hardest hit by

5425
04:18:30 --> 04:18:31
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>the recession.

5426
04:18:31 --> 04:18:34
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>In new hampshire, the number of

5427
04:18:34 --> 04:18:35
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>people who are working in the

5428
04:18:35 --> 04:18:37
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>construction industry in 2010

5429
04:18:37 --> 04:18:38
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>was the lowest it's been in a

5430
04:18:38 --> 04:18:42
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>decade.

5431
04:18:42 --> 04:18:44
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>25% lower than it was in just

5432
04:18:44 --> 04:18:47
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>2006, so just five years ago.

5433
04:18:47 --> 04:18:48
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>we need to pass this bill to

5434
04:18:48 --> 04:18:50
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>help put those people back to

5435
04:18:50 --> 04:18:52
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>work.

5436
04:18:52 --> 04:18:53
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>One of the most important

5437
04:18:53 --> 04:18:56
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>efforts that we have in new

5438
04:18:56 --> 04:18:57
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>hampshire right now is the long

5439
04:18:57 --> 04:19:00
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>overdue and badly needed

5440
04:19:00 --> 04:19:01
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>widening of interstate 93, which

5441
04:19:01 --> 04:19:03
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>is in the southern part of new

5442
04:19:03 --> 04:19:04
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>hampshire.

5443
04:19:04 --> 04:19:06
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>I-93 is our state's most

5444
04:19:06 --> 04:19:08
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>important highway.

5445
04:19:08 --> 04:19:09
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>it connects new hampshire

5446
04:19:09 --> 04:19:10
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>citizens to their jobs,

5447
04:19:10 --> 04:19:13
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>businesses to global markets,

5448
04:19:13 --> 04:19:16
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>and communities to each other.

5449
04:19:16 --> 04:19:17
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>Right now this vital artery is

5450
04:19:17 --> 04:19:19
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>badly clogged.

5451
04:19:19 --> 04:19:22
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>Every day, 100,000 cars travel

5452
04:19:22 --> 04:19:24
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>on a road designed for 60,000.

5453
04:19:24 --> 04:19:27
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>This congestion wastes time and

5454
04:19:27 --> 04:19:29
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>it wastes money.

5455
04:19:29 --> 04:19:31
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>and crowding so many vehicles on

5456
04:19:31 --> 04:19:32
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>interstate 93 is not only an

5457
04:19:32 --> 04:19:37
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>inconvenience to the thousands

5458
04:19:37 --> 04:19:38
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>who use it everyday, but it also

5459
04:19:38 --> 04:19:39
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>compromises the safety of

5460
04:19:39 --> 04:19:43
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>drivers traveling at regular

5461
04:19:43 --> 04:19:45
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>highway speeds in heavy traffic.

5462
04:19:45 --> 04:19:48
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>The interstate 93 project was

5463
04:19:48 --> 04:19:49
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>budgeted and planned based on

5464
04:19:49 --> 04:19:50
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>the idea that the federal

5465
04:19:50 --> 04:19:53
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>government would provide a

5466
04:19:53 --> 04:19:55
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>consistent level of funding, but

5467
04:19:55 --> 04:19:56
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>the uncertainty created by the

5468
04:19:56 --> 04:19:57
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>lack of a long-term highway bill

5469
04:19:57 --> 04:19:59
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>has made the project difficult

5470
04:19:59 --> 04:20:01
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>to finance.

5471
04:20:01 --> 04:20:04
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>Right now, new hampshire

5472
04:20:04 --> 04:20:05
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>transportation officials have

5473
04:20:05 --> 04:20:07
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>$115 million worth of bonding

5474
04:20:07 --> 04:20:08
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>for this project that's sitting

5475
04:20:08 --> 04:20:10
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>on the sidelines until the

5476
04:20:10 --> 04:20:13
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>federal government makes good on

5477
04:20:13 --> 04:20:15
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>its commitments.

5478
04:20:15 --> 04:20:18
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>We need to move these federal

5479
04:20:18 --> 04:20:21
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>funds off the sidelines and get

5480
04:20:21 --> 04:20:23
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>this project going.

5481
04:20:23 --> 04:20:24
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>Laura scott, who's the economic

5482
04:20:24 --> 04:20:26
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>development director for the

5483
04:20:26 --> 04:20:28
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>town of wyndham, near the

5484
04:20:28 --> 04:20:29
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>massachusetts borders, summed it

5485
04:20:29 --> 04:20:31
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>up best.

5486
04:20:31 --> 04:20:33
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>&quot;the I-93 project is critical to

5487
04:20:33 --> 04:20:35
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>the future economic vitality of

5488
04:20:35 --> 04:20:36
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>wyndham and all of southern new

5489
04:20:36 --> 04:20:37
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>hampshire,&quot; she said.

5490
04:20:37 --> 04:20:39
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>&quot;our businesses want it, our

5491
04:20:39 --> 04:20:41
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>citizens want it, and we need to

5492
04:20:41 --> 04:20:43
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>get it done.&quot;

5493
04:20:43 --> 04:20:45
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>the bill before us today can

5494
04:20:45 --> 04:20:47
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>help complete this vital project

5495
04:20:47 --> 04:20:49
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>and others like it.

5496
04:20:49 --> 04:20:51
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>and we need to work on this bill

5497
04:20:51 --> 04:20:53
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>in a bipartisan fashion, just as

5498
04:20:53 --> 04:20:54
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>it's come out of the environment

5499
04:20:54 --> 04:20:59
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>and public works committee.

5500
04:20:59 --> 04:21:00
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>They had a strong, bipartisan

5501
04:21:00 --> 04:21:00
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>support coming out of that

5502
04:21:00 --> 04:21:01
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>committee.

5503
04:21:01 --> 04:21:03
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>We need to set aside the

5504
04:21:03 --> 04:21:04
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>partisanship now, the

5505
04:21:04 --> 04:21:05
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>election-year amendments and

5506
04:21:05 --> 04:21:09
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>come together to do what's right

5507
04:21:09 --> 04:21:11
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>for our economy and our country,

5508
04:21:11 --> 04:21:12
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>and I hope that in the end all

5509
04:21:12 --> 04:21:15
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>of my colleagues on both sides

5510
04:21:15 --> 04:21:17
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>of the aisle will support that.

5511
04:21:17 --> 04:21:18
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>Thank you very much,

5512
04:21:18 --> 04:21:22
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>Mr. President.

5513
04:21:22 --> 04:21:22
<v MRS. SHAHEEN>I note the absence of a quorum.

5514
04:21:22 --> 04:21:26
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the clerk

5515
04:21:26 --> 04:21:26
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>will call the roll.

5516
04:31:25 --> 04:31:25
<v QUORUM CALL>ask is is

5517
04:35:15 --> 04:35:16
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>snoer

5519
04:35:19 --> 04:35:20
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senator from tennessee.

5520
04:35:20 --> 04:35:21
<v MR. CORKER>I'd like to ask

5521
04:35:21 --> 04:35:22
<v MR. CORKER>unanimous consent that the

5522
04:35:22 --> 04:35:23
<v MR. CORKER>quorum call be vitiated.

5523
04:35:23 --> 04:35:23
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

5524
04:35:23 --> 04:35:24
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

5525
04:35:24 --> 04:35:24
<v MR. CORKER>thank you, Mr.

5526
04:35:24 --> 04:35:26
<v MR. CORKER>President.

5527
04:35:26 --> 04:35:27
<v MR. CORKER>I come down here today to talk

5528
04:35:27 --> 04:35:29
<v MR. CORKER>about a topic that I spoke a

5529
04:35:29 --> 04:35:31
<v MR. CORKER>little bit about yesterday on

5530
04:35:31 --> 04:35:33
<v MR. CORKER>the floor about, and I know that

5531
04:35:33 --> 04:35:35
<v MR. CORKER>all the focus right now is

5532
04:35:35 --> 04:35:37
<v MR. CORKER>working on a solution to some of

5533
04:35:37 --> 04:35:38
<v MR. CORKER>the thongs that are going on

5534
04:35:38 --> 04:35:39
<v MR. CORKER>twoon -- some of the things that

5535
04:35:39 --> 04:35:39
<v MR. CORKER>are going on between the house

5536
04:35:39 --> 04:35:41
<v MR. CORKER>and the senate.

5537
04:35:41 --> 04:35:42
<v MR. CORKER>And I know that's what people

5538
04:35:42 --> 04:35:44
<v MR. CORKER>are focused on today.

5539
04:35:44 --> 04:35:46
<v MR. CORKER>I know that probably sometime

5540
04:35:46 --> 04:35:48
<v MR. CORKER>tomorrow there'll be a vote on

5541
04:35:48 --> 04:35:50
<v MR. CORKER>the highway bill that'll fail

5542
04:35:50 --> 04:35:52
<v MR. CORKER>and then my understanding is

5543
04:35:52 --> 04:35:53
<v MR. CORKER>that there will be some

5544
04:35:53 --> 04:35:59
<v MR. CORKER>amendments brought fortunately

5545
04:35:59 --> 04:36:01
<v MR. CORKER>to bring -- brought forth to

5546
04:36:01 --> 04:36:03
<v MR. CORKER>bring three bills together, that

5547
04:36:03 --> 04:36:05
<v MR. CORKER>will ultimately be debated and

5548
04:36:05 --> 04:36:05
<v MR. CORKER>it is my sense will ultimately

5549
04:36:05 --> 04:36:07
<v MR. CORKER>pass.

5550
04:36:07 --> 04:36:09
<v MR. CORKER>We'll be doing that after the

5551
04:36:09 --> 04:36:10
<v MR. CORKER>recess is over and

5552
04:36:10 --> 04:36:11
<v MR. CORKER>, we'll come back

5553
04:36:11 --> 04:36:14
<v MR. CORKER>and deal with that.

5554
04:36:14 --> 04:36:15
<v MR. CORKER>I want to speak to that topic

5555
04:36:15 --> 04:36:20
<v MR. CORKER>and I know I'm becoming a little

5556
04:36:20 --> 04:36:21
<v MR. CORKER>bit of a broken record on this.

5557
04:36:21 --> 04:36:26
<v MR. CORKER>But we've had so many people

5558
04:36:26 --> 04:36:27
<v MR. CORKER>down here on both sides of the

5559
04:36:27 --> 04:36:29
<v MR. CORKER>aisle that have worked for a

5560
04:36:29 --> 04:36:30
<v MR. CORKER>year and a half after the

5561
04:36:30 --> 04:36:32
<v MR. CORKER>bowles-simpson report came out.

5562
04:36:32 --> 04:36:34
<v MR. CORKER>we had so many people that tried

5563
04:36:34 --> 04:36:37
<v MR. CORKER>to work on long-term deficit

5564
04:36:37 --> 04:36:38
<v MR. CORKER>reduction, pro-growth reform,

5565
04:36:38 --> 04:36:40
<v MR. CORKER>entitlement reform.

5566
04:36:40 --> 04:36:41
<v MR. CORKER>There seemed to be a real

5567
04:36:41 --> 04:36:43
<v MR. CORKER>seriousness about that issue and

5568
04:36:43 --> 04:36:45
<v MR. CORKER>I think all of the people who

5569
04:36:45 --> 04:36:47
<v MR. CORKER>have signed letters in support

5570
04:36:47 --> 04:36:49
<v MR. CORKER>of it were very, very sincere.

5571
04:36:49 --> 04:36:51
<v MR. CORKER>And yet I think what we're

5572
04:36:51 --> 04:36:52
<v MR. CORKER>finding with this highway bill

5573
04:36:52 --> 04:36:56
<v MR. CORKER>in spite of the changes that are

5574
04:36:56 --> 04:36:58
<v MR. CORKER>likely to take place with the

5575
04:36:58 --> 04:37:01
<v MR. CORKER>finance component, that what

5576
04:37:01 --> 04:37:01
<v MR. CORKER>we're ending up with is a

5577
04:37:01 --> 04:37:03
<v MR. CORKER>highway bill.

5578
04:37:03 --> 04:37:04
<v MR. CORKER>And there's nobody in this body

5579
04:37:04 --> 04:37:06
<v MR. CORKER>that likes infrastructure more

5580
04:37:06 --> 04:37:08
<v MR. CORKER>than me or has spent more time

5581
04:37:08 --> 04:37:11
<v MR. CORKER>on the back after paving machine

5582
04:37:11 --> 04:37:12
<v MR. CORKER>or on a street.

5583
04:37:12 --> 04:37:13
<v MR. CORKER>those are the kinds of things

5584
04:37:13 --> 04:37:16
<v MR. CORKER>that I love seeing happening.

5585
04:37:16 --> 04:37:17
<v MR. CORKER>I know they create jobs and

5586
04:37:17 --> 04:37:18
<v MR. CORKER>tremendous economic growth over

5587
04:37:18 --> 04:37:20
<v MR. CORKER>the long haul.

5588
04:37:20 --> 04:37:23
<v MR. CORKER>But what we're ending up with in

5589
04:37:23 --> 04:37:24
<v MR. CORKER>this highway bill is a situation

5590
04:37:24 --> 04:37:27
<v MR. CORKER>where we have two years' worth

5591
04:37:27 --> 04:37:29
<v MR. CORKER>of spending that is taking place

5592
04:37:29 --> 04:37:30
<v MR. CORKER>and we're using ten years' worth

5593
04:37:30 --> 04:37:32
<v MR. CORKER>of pay-s for.

5594
04:37:32 --> 04:37:34
<v MR. CORKER>i know the presiding officer

5595
04:37:34 --> 04:37:36
<v MR. CORKER>remembers the debate that we had

5596
04:37:36 --> 04:37:38
<v MR. CORKER>for a long, long time here in

5597
04:37:38 --> 04:37:39
<v MR. CORKER>the body over health care, and I

5598
04:37:39 --> 04:37:40
<v MR. CORKER>know the presiding officer

5599
04:37:40 --> 04:37:42
<v MR. CORKER>remembers the tremendous

5600
04:37:42 --> 04:37:45
<v MR. CORKER>discussions that took place on

5601
04:37:45 --> 04:37:46
<v MR. CORKER>the floor over the financing

5602
04:37:46 --> 04:37:47
<v MR. CORKER>mechanisms, and I don't think

5603
04:37:47 --> 04:37:50
<v MR. CORKER>there's any question that people

5604
04:37:50 --> 04:37:52
<v MR. CORKER>on my side of the aisle railed

5605
04:37:52 --> 04:37:54
<v MR. CORKER>strongly had I might say, as

5606
04:37:54 --> 04:37:56
<v MR. CORKER>they should have, over the fact

5607
04:37:56 --> 04:37:58
<v MR. CORKER>that we were going to -- had a

5608
04:37:58 --> 04:38:00
<v MR. CORKER>pay-for formula where basically

5609
04:38:00 --> 04:38:01
<v MR. CORKER>we were spending money over a

5610
04:38:01 --> 04:38:03
<v MR. CORKER>six-year period and paying for

5611
04:38:03 --> 04:38:05
<v MR. CORKER>it over ten.

5612
04:38:05 --> 04:38:07
<v MR. CORKER>And ultimately the bill passed,

5613
04:38:07 --> 04:38:11
<v MR. CORKER>but there was tremendous divide

5614
04:38:11 --> 04:38:13
<v MR. CORKER>in this body over really mostly

5615
04:38:13 --> 04:38:14
<v MR. CORKER>just the budget gimmickry that

5616
04:38:14 --> 04:38:16
<v MR. CORKER>took place.

5617
04:38:16 --> 04:38:19
<v MR. CORKER>And yet what I see getting ready

5618
04:38:19 --> 04:38:21
<v MR. CORKER>to happen in a large bipartisan

5619
04:38:21 --> 04:38:23
<v MR. CORKER>way is we're going to vote for a

5620
04:38:23 --> 04:38:25
<v MR. CORKER>highway bill, possibly -- I'm

5621
04:38:25 --> 04:38:28
<v MR. CORKER>not going to do -- but a bill

5622
04:38:28 --> 04:38:30
<v MR. CORKER>that spends money over a

5623
04:38:30 --> 04:38:32
<v MR. CORKER>two-year period and recruits it

5624
04:38:32 --> 04:38:35
<v MR. CORKER>over ten.

5625
04:38:35 --> 04:38:37
<v MR. CORKER>i'm actually stunned by this.

5626
04:38:37 --> 04:38:39
<v MR. CORKER>And, you know, we talk about all

5627
04:38:39 --> 04:38:40
<v MR. CORKER>the things we need to do in this

5628
04:38:40 --> 04:38:43
<v MR. CORKER>body regarding medicare and how

5629
04:38:43 --> 04:38:45
<v MR. CORKER>we need to focus on reforms that

5630
04:38:45 --> 04:38:47
<v MR. CORKER>make sure that the seniors in

5631
04:38:47 --> 04:38:48
<v MR. CORKER>vermont and seniors in tennessee

5632
04:38:48 --> 04:38:49
<v MR. CORKER>have these programs down the

5633
04:38:49 --> 04:38:50
<v MR. CORKER>road.

5634
04:38:50 --> 04:38:51
<v MR. CORKER>We talk about medicare in the

5635
04:38:51 --> 04:38:52
<v MR. CORKER>same light.

5636
04:38:52 --> 04:38:54
<v MR. CORKER>I think all of us want to make

5637
04:38:54 --> 04:38:56
<v MR. CORKER>sure that social security is --

5638
04:38:56 --> 04:38:58
<v MR. CORKER>social security is here for

5639
04:38:58 --> 04:39:00
<v MR. CORKER>future generations, for these

5640
04:39:00 --> 04:39:01
<v MR. CORKER>young people in front of us.

5641
04:39:01 --> 04:39:02
<v MR. CORKER>And all of us know that we've

5642
04:39:02 --> 04:39:03
<v MR. CORKER>got to figure out a way to solve

5643
04:39:03 --> 04:39:06
<v MR. CORKER>that problem.

5644
04:39:06 --> 04:39:08
<v MR. CORKER>And yet what's getting ready to

5645
04:39:08 --> 04:39:10
<v MR. CORKER>happen on a highway bill that is

5646
04:39:10 --> 04:39:12
<v MR. CORKER>like really simple -- I mean,

5647
04:39:12 --> 04:39:13
<v MR. CORKER>it's unlike medicare, it's

5648
04:39:13 --> 04:39:15
<v MR. CORKER>unlike medicaid, it's unlike so

5649
04:39:15 --> 04:39:18
<v MR. CORKER>many of the things that we deal

5650
04:39:18 --> 04:39:20
<v MR. CORKER>with around here that are so

5651
04:39:20 --> 04:39:22
<v MR. CORKER>complex, to get it just right --

5652
04:39:22 --> 04:39:26
<v MR. CORKER>we have a highway bill, and it's

5653
04:39:26 --> 04:39:29
<v MR. CORKER>kind of like math.

5654
04:39:29 --> 04:39:31
<v MR. CORKER>It's not really complicated.

5655
04:39:31 --> 04:39:32
<v MR. CORKER>There aren't all kinds of moving

5656
04:39:32 --> 04:39:34
<v MR. CORKER>parts as far as people providing

5657
04:39:34 --> 04:39:35
<v MR. CORKER>health care and incentives that

5658
04:39:35 --> 04:39:36
<v MR. CORKER>are in place.

5659
04:39:36 --> 04:39:39
<v MR. CORKER>And what we're getting ready to

5660
04:39:39 --> 04:39:41
<v MR. CORKER>do as a body, it feels like to

5661
04:39:41 --> 04:39:43
<v MR. CORKER>me -- I hope this is not the

5662
04:39:43 --> 04:39:45
<v MR. CORKER>case -- is pass a highway bill

5663
04:39:45 --> 04:39:47
<v MR. CORKER>where what we're going to do is

5664
04:39:47 --> 04:39:49
<v MR. CORKER>exactly what we've done with

5665
04:39:49 --> 04:39:50
<v MR. CORKER>what's called the sustainable

5666
04:39:50 --> 04:39:51
<v MR. CORKER>growth rate for physicians in

5667
04:39:51 --> 04:39:54
<v MR. CORKER>medicare.

5668
04:39:54 --> 04:39:55
<v MR. CORKER>Back in 1997, we passed a bill

5669
04:39:55 --> 04:39:58
<v MR. CORKER>here -- I wasn't here at the

5670
04:39:58 --> 04:40:01
<v MR. CORKER>time -- that basically created a

5671
04:40:01 --> 04:40:03
<v MR. CORKER>mechanism, create add mechanism

5672
04:40:03 --> 04:40:04
<v MR. CORKER>for paying physicians and

5673
04:40:04 --> 04:40:06
<v MR. CORKER>providers -- physicians that

5674
04:40:06 --> 04:40:08
<v MR. CORKER>dealt with seniors.

5675
04:40:08 --> 04:40:10
<v MR. CORKER>And the formula was flawed, and

5676
04:40:10 --> 04:40:15
<v MR. CORKER>so what we've done every 18

5677
04:40:15 --> 04:40:16
<v MR. CORKER>months or every year is call

5678
04:40:16 --> 04:40:18
<v MR. CORKER>it

5679
04:40:18 --> 04:40:20
<v MR. CORKER>causes the medical community to

5680
04:40:20 --> 04:40:22
<v MR. CORKER>be panicked over whether this

5681
04:40:22 --> 04:40:23
<v MR. CORKER>will be extended because the

5682
04:40:23 --> 04:40:27
<v MR. CORKER>sustainable growth rate as it

5683
04:40:27 --> 04:40:28
<v MR. CORKER>was put forth was cause for huge

5684
04:40:28 --> 04:40:29
<v MR. CORKER>reductions and payments to

5685
04:40:29 --> 04:40:30
<v MR. CORKER>physicians.

5686
04:40:30 --> 04:40:31
<v MR. CORKER>That's one of the issues we're

5687
04:40:31 --> 04:40:31
<v MR. CORKER>trying to work out with the

5688
04:40:31 --> 04:40:33
<v MR. CORKER>house.

5689
04:40:33 --> 04:40:34
<v MR. CORKER>What we did is we created a

5690
04:40:34 --> 04:40:35
<v MR. CORKER>cliff.

5691
04:40:35 --> 04:40:37
<v MR. CORKER>so every time we deal with this

5692
04:40:37 --> 04:40:39
<v MR. CORKER>issue, it gets more and more

5693
04:40:39 --> 04:40:40
<v MR. CORKER>difficult to deal with it

5694
04:40:40 --> 04:40:41
<v MR. CORKER>because we will not just sit

5695
04:40:41 --> 04:40:43
<v MR. CORKER>down and do the long-term

5696
04:40:43 --> 04:40:45
<v MR. CORKER>reforms on that one component

5697
04:40:45 --> 04:40:47
<v MR. CORKER>that need to happen.

5698
04:40:47 --> 04:40:49
<v MR. CORKER>And so we keep taking from peter

5699
04:40:49 --> 04:40:52
<v MR. CORKER>to pay paul, we keep wrestling

5700
04:40:52 --> 04:40:53
<v MR. CORKER>with this issue, but we won't

5701
04:40:53 --> 04:40:53
<v MR. CORKER>deal with it.

5702
04:40:54 --> 04:40:55
<v MR. CORKER>What we're getting ready to do

5703
04:40:55 --> 04:40:59
<v MR. CORKER>with the highway bill is

5704
04:40:59 --> 04:41:00
<v MR. CORKER>basically inject that same

5705
04:41:00 --> 04:41:01
<v MR. CORKER>poisonous formula into the

5706
04:41:01 --> 04:41:03
<v MR. CORKER>highway bill.

5707
04:41:03 --> 04:41:04
<v MR. CORKER>What we're getting ready to do

5708
04:41:04 --> 04:41:06
<v MR. CORKER>is again pass a highway bill

5709
04:41:06 --> 04:41:07
<v MR. CORKER>that's going to fund highways

5710
04:41:07 --> 04:41:09
<v MR. CORKER>through 2013 but at the end of

5711
04:41:09 --> 04:41:10
<v MR. CORKER>that period of time we're going

5712
04:41:10 --> 04:41:14
<v MR. CORKER>0 have the same kind of cliff

5713
04:41:14 --> 04:41:15
<v MR. CORKER>that we deal with with S.G.R.

5714
04:41:15 --> 04:41:17
<v MR. CORKER>We got a $10 billion shortfall.

5715
04:41:17 --> 04:41:19
<v MR. CORKER>so instead of just dealing with

5716
04:41:19 --> 04:41:21
<v MR. CORKER>the funding formula.

5717
04:41:21 --> 04:41:23
<v MR. CORKER>I mean, if we don't think we're

5718
04:41:23 --> 04:41:24
<v MR. CORKER>spending enough on

5719
04:41:24 --> 04:41:26
<v MR. CORKER>infrastructure and people want

5720
04:41:26 --> 04:41:29
<v MR. CORKER>to alter that in some way, now

5721
04:41:29 --> 04:41:30
<v MR. CORKER>is the time to do it.

5722
04:41:30 --> 04:41:33
<v MR. CORKER>Otherwise if people don't want

5723
04:41:33 --> 04:41:34
<v MR. CORKER>to go into a deficit situation,

5724
04:41:34 --> 04:41:36
<v MR. CORKER>what we ought to do is spend the

5725
04:41:36 --> 04:41:37
<v MR. CORKER>amount of money that's coming

5726
04:41:37 --> 04:41:39
<v MR. CORKER>in.

5727
04:41:39 --> 04:41:40
<v MR. CORKER>But what it feels like to me is

5728
04:41:40 --> 04:41:44
<v MR. CORKER>getting ready is happen when we

5729
04:41:44 --> 04:41:46
<v MR. CORKER>get back from recess is in a

5730
04:41:46 --> 04:41:49
<v MR. CORKER>very bipartisan way we're going

5731
04:41:49 --> 04:41:51
<v MR. CORKER>to show the country that to

5732
04:41:51 --> 04:41:53
<v MR. CORKER>think about doing the kind of

5733
04:41:53 --> 04:41:54
<v MR. CORKER>reforms to medicare to make it

5734
04:41:54 --> 04:41:55
<v MR. CORKER>solvent, to think about doing

5735
04:41:55 --> 04:41:57
<v MR. CORKER>the kind of things that we need

5736
04:41:57 --> 04:42:01
<v MR. CORKER>to do with social security, both

5737
04:42:01 --> 04:42:03
<v MR. CORKER>of which are more complex, is

5738
04:42:03 --> 04:42:06
<v MR. CORKER>ridiculous with this congress

5739
04:42:06 --> 04:42:08
<v MR. CORKER>because this congress won't even

5740
04:42:08 --> 04:42:10
<v MR. CORKER>deal with the little program --

5741
04:42:10 --> 04:42:12
<v MR. CORKER>a very important program, very

5742
04:42:12 --> 04:42:14
<v MR. CORKER>important to my state, I'm sure

5743
04:42:14 --> 04:42:16
<v MR. CORKER>important to vermont -- but we

5744
04:42:16 --> 04:42:19
<v MR. CORKER>won't even deal with the reforms

5745
04:42:19 --> 04:42:21
<v MR. CORKER>to it in this time of great

5746
04:42:21 --> 04:42:22
<v MR. CORKER>concern about our fiscal

5747
04:42:22 --> 04:42:24
<v MR. CORKER>situation.

5748
04:42:24 --> 04:42:26
<v MR. CORKER>Again, I strongly support

5749
04:42:26 --> 04:42:27
<v MR. CORKER>infrastructure funding.

5750
04:42:27 --> 04:42:30
<v MR. CORKER>So I think what it's going to

5751
04:42:30 --> 04:42:33
<v MR. CORKER>show to the country is that if

5752
04:42:33 --> 04:42:34
<v MR. CORKER>we pass a bill like this in a

5753
04:42:34 --> 04:42:37
<v MR. CORKER>strong bipartisan way, that

5754
04:42:37 --> 04:42:39
<v MR. CORKER>basically congress is democrat

5755
04:42:39 --> 04:42:42
<v MR. CORKER>straiting that there's very

5756
04:42:42 --> 04:42:43
<v MR. CORKER>little hope that we ever -- is

5757
04:42:43 --> 04:42:44
<v MR. CORKER>demonstrating that there's very

5758
04:42:44 --> 04:42:45
<v MR. CORKER>little hope that we ever are

5759
04:42:45 --> 04:42:47
<v MR. CORKER>going to deal with the more

5760
04:42:47 --> 04:42:49
<v MR. CORKER>complex issues that challenge

5761
04:42:49 --> 04:42:50
<v MR. CORKER>this country, cause many seniors

5762
04:42:50 --> 04:42:52
<v MR. CORKER>to be concerned, cause taxpayers

5763
04:42:52 --> 04:42:53
<v MR. CORKER>to be very concerned, and

5764
04:42:53 --> 04:42:55
<v MR. CORKER>certainly cause future

5765
04:42:55 --> 04:42:57
<v MR. CORKER>generations to wonder whether

5766
04:42:57 --> 04:42:59
<v MR. CORKER>this body is ever is going too

5767
04:42:59 --> 04:43:00
<v MR. CORKER>deal with the issues -- is ever

5768
04:43:00 --> 04:43:02
<v MR. CORKER>is going to deal with the issues

5769
04:43:02 --> 04:43:02
<v MR. CORKER>that they know will haunt them

5770
04:43:02 --> 04:43:05
<v MR. CORKER>down the road.

5771
04:43:05 --> 04:43:07
<v MR. CORKER>So I came down to speak to this.

5772
04:43:07 --> 04:43:09
<v MR. CORKER>I've done it daily in the lunch

5773
04:43:09 --> 04:43:09
<v MR. CORKER>meetings that we have with our

5774
04:43:09 --> 04:43:11
<v MR. CORKER>own side.

5775
04:43:11 --> 04:43:15
<v MR. CORKER>And I just hope that sometime

5776
04:43:15 --> 04:43:16
<v MR. CORKER>over the recess period, prior to

5777
04:43:16 --> 04:43:18
<v MR. CORKER>-- prior to coming to the floor

5778
04:43:18 --> 04:43:20
<v MR. CORKER>-- that the finance committee

5779
04:43:20 --> 04:43:21
<v MR. CORKER>will come up with a different

5780
04:43:21 --> 04:43:24
<v MR. CORKER>package that actually either

5781
04:43:24 --> 04:43:28
<v MR. CORKER>pays nor this bill

5782
04:43:28 --> 04:43:31
<v MR. CORKER>for this bill, by altering

5783
04:43:31 --> 04:43:32
<v MR. CORKER>funding formulas -- which, bit

5784
04:43:32 --> 04:43:34
<v MR. CORKER>way, it's just math, not very

5785
04:43:34 --> 04:43:35
<v MR. CORKER>difficult -- or where we spend

5786
04:43:35 --> 04:43:36
<v MR. CORKER>amount of money that's actually

5787
04:43:36 --> 04:43:38
<v MR. CORKER>coming in.

5788
04:43:38 --> 04:43:40
<v MR. CORKER>I will say that states do have

5789
04:43:40 --> 04:43:42
<v MR. CORKER>the ability, if they so chose

5790
04:43:42 --> 04:43:45
<v MR. CORKER>to, if we spent just the base

5791
04:43:45 --> 04:43:46
<v MR. CORKER>moneys that are coming in --

5792
04:43:46 --> 04:43:48
<v MR. CORKER>states like vert and tennessee

5793
04:43:48 --> 04:43:49
<v MR. CORKER>and other -- like vermont and

5794
04:43:49 --> 04:43:51
<v MR. CORKER>tennessee and other places have

5795
04:43:51 --> 04:43:52
<v MR. CORKER>the ability if they choose to

5796
04:43:52 --> 04:43:54
<v MR. CORKER>generate gasoline tax in their

5797
04:43:54 --> 04:43:56
<v MR. CORKER>own states and do things with

5798
04:43:56 --> 04:43:57
<v MR. CORKER>road money and candidly the way

5799
04:43:57 --> 04:43:59
<v MR. CORKER>this program works, I think most

5800
04:43:59 --> 04:44:03
<v MR. CORKER>people know that citizens send

5801
04:44:03 --> 04:44:04
<v MR. CORKER>up a dollar and they get back 98

5802
04:44:04 --> 04:44:05
<v MR. CORKER>cents.

5803
04:44:05 --> 04:44:08
<v MR. CORKER>So it actually could be a more

5804
04:44:08 --> 04:44:10
<v MR. CORKER>efficient way thor this to work

5805
04:44:10 --> 04:44:11
<v MR. CORKER>than sending it up to us and

5806
04:44:11 --> 04:44:12
<v MR. CORKER>letting us figure out what we're

5807
04:44:12 --> 04:44:15
<v MR. CORKER>going to do with the money.

5808
04:44:15 --> 04:44:16
<v MR. CORKER>But the fact is that I really do

5809
04:44:16 --> 04:44:18
<v MR. CORKER>believe this is one of the most

5810
04:44:18 --> 04:44:20
<v MR. CORKER>irresponsible things that we can

5811
04:44:20 --> 04:44:22
<v MR. CORKER>do, especially when I think that

5812
04:44:22 --> 04:44:23
<v MR. CORKER>there May have been some

5813
04:44:23 --> 04:44:25
<v MR. CORKER>criticisms of the President's

5814
04:44:25 --> 04:44:28
<v MR. CORKER>budget -- I haven't heard a lot

5815
04:44:28 --> 04:44:29
<v MR. CORKER>of people speak about it because

5816
04:44:29 --> 04:44:30
<v MR. CORKER>I don't think it's been taken as

5817
04:44:30 --> 04:44:32
<v MR. CORKER>a document that we're going to

5818
04:44:32 --> 04:44:32
<v MR. CORKER>take up on this floor in are a

5819
04:44:32 --> 04:44:35
<v MR. CORKER>real way.

5820
04:44:35 --> 04:44:38
<v MR. CORKER>But it's really difficult to

5821
04:44:38 --> 04:44:39
<v MR. CORKER>criticize the President's budget

5822
04:44:39 --> 04:44:41
<v MR. CORKER>budget.

5823
04:44:41 --> 04:44:44
<v MR. CORKER>i know last year's budget was

5824
04:44:44 --> 04:44:45
<v MR. CORKER>was

5825
04:44:45 --> 04:44:47
<v MR. CORKER>97-0 insurgence.

5826
04:44:47 --> 04:44:48
<v MR. CORKER>But it's very give for people on

5827
04:44:48 --> 04:44:51
<v MR. CORKER>both sides of the aisle for

5828
04:44:51 --> 04:44:53
<v MR. CORKER>people too criticize the budget

5829
04:44:53 --> 04:44:56
<v MR. CORKER>if in fact there's a large

5830
04:44:56 --> 04:44:57
<v MR. CORKER>bipartisan desire to pass a high --

5831
04:44:57 --> 04:44:58
<v MR. CORKER>pass a highway bill that does

5832
04:44:58 --> 04:45:00
<v MR. CORKER>exactly the same thing.

5833
04:45:00 --> 04:45:02
<v MR. CORKER>I hope the finance committee

5834
04:45:02 --> 04:45:05
<v MR. CORKER>will meet again and will come up

5835
04:45:05 --> 04:45:07
<v MR. CORKER>with a solution to this.

5836
04:45:07 --> 04:45:09
<v MR. CORKER>It's not urgent.

5837
04:45:09 --> 04:45:11
<v MR. CORKER>We have a recess period that's

5838
04:45:11 --> 04:45:14
<v MR. CORKER>coming up.

5839
04:45:14 --> 04:45:15
<v MR. CORKER>And surely, surely that this

5840
04:45:15 --> 04:45:18
<v MR. CORKER>congress, this senate can show

5841
04:45:18 --> 04:45:20
<v MR. CORKER>the ability to deal with an

5842
04:45:20 --> 04:45:20
<v MR. CORKER>issue like this, again that's so

5843
04:45:20 --> 04:45:21
<v MR. CORKER>simple.

5844
04:45:21 --> 04:45:23
<v MR. CORKER>and demonstrate to the american

5845
04:45:23 --> 04:45:25
<v MR. CORKER>people that in a bipartisan way

5846
04:45:25 --> 04:45:27
<v MR. CORKER>we have the ability to begin

5847
04:45:27 --> 04:45:28
<v MR. CORKER>looking at these programs that

5848
04:45:28 --> 04:45:31
<v MR. CORKER>are so important to people

5849
04:45:31 --> 04:45:33
<v MR. CORKER>across our country in a way that

5850
04:45:33 --> 04:45:33
<v MR. CORKER>doesn't take us down the fiscal

5851
04:45:33 --> 04:45:35
<v MR. CORKER>tube.

5852
04:45:35 --> 04:45:35
<v MR. CORKER>Mr. President, I thank you for

5853
04:45:35 --> 04:45:38
<v MR. CORKER>listening.

5854
04:45:38 --> 04:45:39
<v MR. CORKER>I know it's tough when there's

5855
04:45:39 --> 04:45:40
<v MR. CORKER>not much happening down here.

5856
04:45:40 --> 04:45:44
<v MR. CORKER>I notice the absence of a quorum

5857
04:45:44 --> 04:45:45
<v MR. CORKER>and I yield the floor.

5858
04:45:44 --> 04:45:48

5859
04:45:48 --> 04:45:48

<v MR. BEGICH>discrimination taking place

5892
05:01:00 --> 05:01:01
<v MR. BEGICH>against the first people of

05:01:04 --> 05:01:06
<v MR. BEGICH>in many places in southeast

05:01:19 --> 05:01:25

05:01:31 --> 05:01:33
<v MR. BEGICH>they could only send their

5905
05:01:33 --> 05:01:34
<v MR. BEGICH>children to missionary schools,

5906
05:01:34 --> 05:01:37
<v MR. BEGICH>not the public schools for which

5907
05:01:37 --> 05:01:40
<v MR. BEGICH>they paid a school tax.

5908
05:01:40 --> 05:01:45
<v MR. BEGICH>In the face of

5909
05:01:45 --> 05:01:46
<v MR. BEGICH>this discrimination, Miss

5910
05:01:46 --> 05:01:47
<v MR. BEGICH>Beradovich demonstrated courage

5911
05:01:47 --> 05:01:49
<v MR. BEGICH>in her convictions, courage

5912
05:01:49 --> 05:01:50
<v MR. BEGICH>which changed the course of

5913
05:01:50 --> 05:01:52
<v MR. BEGICH>civil rights treatment for

5914
05:01:52 --> 05:01:53
<v MR. BEGICH>alaska natives.

5915
05:01:53 --> 05:01:55
<v MR. BEGICH>In 1941, elizabeth and her

5916
05:01:55 --> 05:02:00
<v MR. BEGICH>husband roy wrote a joint letter

5917
05:02:00 --> 05:02:02
<v MR. BEGICH>to the territorial governor

5918
05:02:02 --> 05:02:02
<v MR. BEGICH>earnest greening about their

5919
05:02:02 --> 05:02:04
<v MR. BEGICH>concerns.

5920
05:02:04 --> 05:02:05
<v MR. BEGICH>In part, they wrote -- quote --

5921
05:02:05 --> 05:02:07
<v MR. BEGICH>&quot;my attention has been called to

5922
05:02:07 --> 05:02:10
<v MR. BEGICH>a business establishment which

5923
05:02:10 --> 05:02:13
<v MR. BEGICH>has a sign on the door which

5924
05:02:13 --> 05:02:16
<v MR. BEGICH>reads&quot; no natives allowed --

5925
05:02:16 --> 05:02:16
<v MR. BEGICH>which reads -- &quot;no natives

5926
05:02:16 --> 05:02:18
<v MR. BEGICH>allowed.&quot;

5927
05:02:18 --> 05:02:19
<v MR. BEGICH>in view of the present emergency

5928
05:02:19 --> 05:02:21
<v MR. BEGICH>when unity is being stressed,

5929
05:02:21 --> 05:02:21
<v MR. BEGICH>don't you think it's

5930
05:02:21 --> 05:02:22
<v MR. BEGICH>un-american?

5931
05:02:22 --> 05:02:24
<v MR. BEGICH>We have always contended that we

5932
05:02:24 --> 05:02:26
<v MR. BEGICH>are entitled to every benefit

5933
05:02:26 --> 05:02:27
<v MR. BEGICH>that is accorded our so-called

5934
05:02:27 --> 05:02:29
<v MR. BEGICH>white brothers.

5935
05:02:29 --> 05:02:31
<v MR. BEGICH>We pay the required taxes, taxes

5936
05:02:31 --> 05:02:34
<v MR. BEGICH>in some instances that we feel

5937
05:02:34 --> 05:02:34
<v MR. BEGICH>are unjust such as the school

5938
05:02:34 --> 05:02:36
<v MR. BEGICH>tax.

5939
05:02:36 --> 05:02:38
<v MR. BEGICH>Our native people pay the school

5940
05:02:38 --> 05:02:39
<v MR. BEGICH>tax each year to educate white

5941
05:02:39 --> 05:02:43
<v MR. BEGICH>children, yet they try to

5942
05:02:43 --> 05:02:43
<v MR. BEGICH>exclude our children from these

5943
05:02:43 --> 05:02:45
<v MR. BEGICH>schools.&quot;

5944
05:02:45 --> 05:02:46
<v MR. BEGICH>close quote.

5945
05:02:46 --> 05:02:47
<v MR. BEGICH>although antidiscrimination

5946
05:02:47 --> 05:02:48
<v MR. BEGICH>legislation had been floating

5947
05:02:48 --> 05:02:50
<v MR. BEGICH>around the territorial

5948
05:02:50 --> 05:02:52
<v MR. BEGICH>legislature for years, it had

5949
05:02:52 --> 05:02:54
<v MR. BEGICH>not gained any traction.

5950
05:02:54 --> 05:02:56
<v MR. BEGICH>And again, I want you to put

5951
05:02:56 --> 05:02:59
<v MR. BEGICH>your mind in this time.

5952
05:02:59 --> 05:03:00
<v MR. BEGICH>This was 1940's.

5953
05:03:00 --> 05:03:02
<v MR. BEGICH>Many legislators believed

5954
05:03:02 --> 05:03:03
<v MR. BEGICH>alaskan natives were

5955
05:03:03 --> 05:03:06
<v MR. BEGICH>second-class citizens.

5956
05:03:06 --> 05:03:08
<v MR. BEGICH>this despite the fact they paid

5957
05:03:08 --> 05:03:09
<v MR. BEGICH>taxes, bear arms in defense of

5958
05:03:09 --> 05:03:12
<v MR. BEGICH>this nation and were not endowed

5959
05:03:12 --> 05:03:16
<v MR. BEGICH>with the same rights as others.

5960
05:03:16 --> 05:03:16
<v MR. BEGICH>In 1945, however, hope emerged.

5961
05:03:16 --> 05:03:20
<v MR. BEGICH>Antidiscrimination legislation

5962
05:03:20 --> 05:03:21
<v MR. BEGICH>had passed the alaska statehouse

5963
05:03:21 --> 05:03:22
<v MR. BEGICH>but was stalled in the state

5964
05:03:22 --> 05:03:26
<v MR. BEGICH>senate.

5965
05:03:26 --> 05:03:29
<v MR. BEGICH>one senator made a speech that

5966
05:03:29 --> 05:03:30
<v MR. BEGICH>the natives had only recently

5967
05:03:30 --> 05:03:31
<v MR. BEGICH>emerged from savagery and were

5968
05:03:31 --> 05:03:33
<v MR. BEGICH>not fit for society.

5969
05:03:33 --> 05:03:36
<v MR. BEGICH>He argued they had not had the

5970
05:03:36 --> 05:03:36
<v MR. BEGICH>experience of 5,000 years of

5971
05:03:36 --> 05:03:38
<v MR. BEGICH>civilization.

5972
05:03:38 --> 05:03:42
<v MR. BEGICH>With great courage and composure

5973
05:03:42 --> 05:03:43
<v MR. BEGICH>and poise, elizabeth peradovich

5974
05:03:43 --> 05:03:45
<v MR. BEGICH>confronted the senator who had

5975
05:03:45 --> 05:03:45
<v MR. BEGICH>just belittled her and her

5976
05:03:45 --> 05:03:48
<v MR. BEGICH>people.

5977
05:03:48 --> 05:03:52
<v MR. BEGICH>not only was she a native

5978
05:03:52 --> 05:03:53
<v MR. BEGICH>addressing the multiwhite alaska

5979
05:03:53 --> 05:03:55
<v MR. BEGICH>audience, she was also the first

5980
05:03:55 --> 05:03:56
<v MR. BEGICH>woman ever to address the alaska

5981
05:03:56 --> 05:04:00
<v MR. BEGICH>state senate.

5982
05:04:00 --> 05:04:02
<v MR. BEGICH>In a quiet, steady but bold

5983
05:04:02 --> 05:04:04
<v MR. BEGICH>voice, elizabeth peradovich

5984
05:04:04 --> 05:04:05
<v MR. BEGICH>opened her testimony with the

5985
05:04:05 --> 05:04:08
<v MR. BEGICH>following words -- I would not

5986
05:04:08 --> 05:04:09
<v MR. BEGICH>have expected that I who am

5987
05:04:09 --> 05:04:12
<v MR. BEGICH>barely out of savagery would

5988
05:04:12 --> 05:04:15
<v MR. BEGICH>have to remind the gentleman

5989
05:04:15 --> 05:04:16
<v MR. BEGICH>with 5,000 years of recorded

5990
05:04:16 --> 05:04:17
<v MR. BEGICH>civilization behind them of our

5991
05:04:17 --> 05:04:20
<v MR. BEGICH>bill of rights.

5992
05:04:20 --> 05:04:22
<v MR. BEGICH>She then recounted her personal

5993
05:04:22 --> 05:04:23
<v MR. BEGICH>experience with discrimination,

5994
05:04:23 --> 05:04:25
<v MR. BEGICH>how she and her husband had not

5995
05:04:25 --> 05:04:26
<v MR. BEGICH>been allowed to lease a house in

5996
05:04:26 --> 05:04:29
<v MR. BEGICH>a white neighborhood, how she

5997
05:04:29 --> 05:04:31
<v MR. BEGICH>was prohibited from enrolling

5998
05:04:31 --> 05:04:33
<v MR. BEGICH>her children in the same schools

5999
05:04:33 --> 05:04:35
<v MR. BEGICH>as everyone else, the schools

6000
05:04:35 --> 05:04:38
<v MR. BEGICH>she paid a school tax for, and

6001
05:04:38 --> 05:04:39
<v MR. BEGICH>she talked about the

6002
05:04:39 --> 05:04:40
<v MR. BEGICH>embarrassment her children felt

6003
05:04:40 --> 05:04:43
<v MR. BEGICH>when they were not allowed to

6004
05:04:43 --> 05:04:44
<v MR. BEGICH>sit with their friends in the

6005
05:04:44 --> 05:04:45
<v MR. BEGICH>theater.

6006
05:04:45 --> 05:04:46
<v MR. BEGICH>Following her speech, the senate

6007
05:04:46 --> 05:04:49
<v MR. BEGICH>exploded in applause.

6008
05:04:49 --> 05:04:52
<v MR. BEGICH>her plea had been effective.

6009
05:04:52 --> 05:04:54
<v MR. BEGICH>Opposition that had been so

6010
05:04:54 --> 05:04:55
<v MR. BEGICH>absolute shrank to a mere

6011
05:04:55 --> 05:04:58
<v MR. BEGICH>whisper.

6012
05:04:58 --> 05:05:01
<v MR. BEGICH>On February 8, 1945 -- and

6013
05:05:01 --> 05:05:02
<v MR. BEGICH>again, I underline the date,

6014
05:05:02 --> 05:05:05
<v MR. BEGICH>thinking of our national

6015
05:05:05 --> 05:05:08
<v MR. BEGICH>history -- on February 8, 1945,

6016
05:05:08 --> 05:05:09
<v MR. BEGICH>a bill to end discrimination in

6017
05:05:09 --> 05:05:13
<v MR. BEGICH>alaska passed the senate by a

6018
05:05:13 --> 05:05:18
<v MR. BEGICH>vote of 11-5.

6019
05:05:18 --> 05:05:19
<v MR. BEGICH>Elizabeth beradovich had been

6020
05:05:19 --> 05:05:20
<v MR. BEGICH>instrumental in making alaska

6021
05:05:20 --> 05:05:23
<v MR. BEGICH>the first organized government

6022
05:05:23 --> 05:05:24
<v MR. BEGICH>under the U.S. Flag to condemn

6023
05:05:24 --> 05:05:26
<v MR. BEGICH>discrimination.

6024
05:05:26 --> 05:05:28
<v MR. BEGICH>Today in alaska we celebrate

6025
05:05:28 --> 05:05:31
<v MR. BEGICH>elizabeth peradovich day and

6026
05:05:31 --> 05:05:33
<v MR. BEGICH>affirm our beliefs in equality.

6027
05:05:33 --> 05:05:34
<v MR. BEGICH>With eechg passing year, we move

6028
05:05:34 --> 05:05:36
<v MR. BEGICH>closer to truly realizing the

6029
05:05:36 --> 05:05:39
<v MR. BEGICH>quote that all men are created

6030
05:05:39 --> 05:05:40
<v MR. BEGICH>equal and all are endowed with

6031
05:05:40 --> 05:05:41
<v MR. BEGICH>certain inalienable rights.

6032
05:05:41 --> 05:05:42
<v MR. BEGICH>Thank you for allowing me to

6033
05:05:43 --> 05:05:45
<v MR. BEGICH>embrace the memory of one brave

6034
05:05:45 --> 05:05:48
<v MR. BEGICH>woman who fought for those

6035
05:05:48 --> 05:05:52
<v MR. BEGICH>fundamental principles --

6036
05:05:52 --> 05:05:54
<v MR. BEGICH>alaskan elizabeth peradovich.

6037
05:05:54 --> 05:05:55
<v MR. BEGICH>Madam Chair, I see an absence of

6038
05:05:55 --> 05:05:55
<v MR. BEGICH>a quorum.

<v MR. BINGAMAN>I'd ask that the

05:18:28 --> 05:18:30

<v MR. BINGAMAN>fight against lung cancer.

6068
05:19:18 --> 05:19:20
<v MR. BINGAMAN>I'm certain he will bring the

6069
05:19:20 --> 05:19:22
<v MR. BINGAMAN>same strength and tenacity to

6070
05:19:22 --> 05:19:24
<v MR. BINGAMAN>that battle that he's brought to

6071
05:19:24 --> 05:19:27
<v MR. BINGAMAN>every other endeavor that he has

6072
05:19:27 --> 05:19:29
<v MR. BINGAMAN>taken on throughout his life.

6073
05:19:29 --> 05:19:31
<v MR. BINGAMAN>Throughout his long career,

6074
05:19:31 --> 05:19:34
<v MR. BINGAMAN>he's fought fiercely to ensure

6075
05:19:34 --> 05:19:36
<v MR. BINGAMAN>that the needs of his fellow new

05:19:36 --> 05:19:38

05:19:38 --> 05:19:40
<v MR. BINGAMAN>He's worked hard to improve the

<v MR. BINGAMAN>our workers.

6082
05:19:45 --> 05:19:47
<v MR. BINGAMAN>And he's worked hard at the

6083
05:19:47 --> 05:19:49
<v MR. BINGAMAN>strengthening of our economy.

6084
05:19:49 --> 05:19:50
<v MR. BINGAMAN>I know I speak for all of his

6085
05:19:50 --> 05:19:53
<v MR. BINGAMAN>colleagues in our state

6086
05:19:53 --> 05:19:56
<v MR. BINGAMAN>legislature when I say that his

6087
05:19:56 --> 05:19:58
<v MR. BINGAMAN>service and strength throughout

6088
05:19:58 --> 05:20:00
<v MR. BINGAMAN>his recent personal difficulties

6089
05:20:00 --> 05:20:02
<v MR. BINGAMAN>have been an inspiration to

6090
05:20:02 --> 05:20:04
<v MR. BINGAMAN>all, and his fighting spirit

6091
05:20:04 --> 05:20:08
<v MR. BINGAMAN>will be missed once he leaves

6092
05:20:08 --> 05:20:09
<v MR. BINGAMAN>our legislature.

6093
05:20:09 --> 05:20:11
<v MR. BINGAMAN>His exemplary work ethic is

6094
05:20:11 --> 05:20:11
<v MR. BINGAMAN>something which we should all

6095
05:20:11 --> 05:20:13
<v MR. BINGAMAN>aspire to.

6096
05:20:13 --> 05:20:17
<v MR. BINGAMAN>He was born into a family of

6097
05:20:17 --> 05:20:20
<v MR. BINGAMAN>nine children, the son of a

05:26:32 --> 05:26:35
<v MR. UDALL>Ben is an inspiration, not just

6289
05:26:35 --> 05:26:37
<v MR. UDALL>to those who aspire to a life of

6290
05:26:37 --> 05:26:40
<v MR. UDALL>public service, but also to a

6291
05:26:40 --> 05:26:42
<v MR. UDALL>life of personal integrity.

6292
05:26:42 --> 05:26:44
<v MR. UDALL>His word is his bond.

6293
05:26:44 --> 05:26:45
<v MR. UDALL>To his family, to the people of

6294
05:26:45 --> 05:26:48
<v MR. UDALL>new mexico.

6295
05:26:48 --> 05:26:49
<v MR. UDALL>His principles have illuminated

6296
05:26:49 --> 05:26:51
<v MR. UDALL>his life and brightened the

6297
05:26:51 --> 05:26:54
<v MR. UDALL>lives of all who know him.

6298
05:26:54 --> 05:26:54
<v MR. UDALL>I count myself among that

6299
05:26:54 --> 05:26:57
<v MR. UDALL>number.

6300
05:26:57 --> 05:26:58
<v MR. UDALL>I'm proud to call ben lujan my

6301
05:26:58 --> 05:27:00
<v MR. UDALL>friend.

6302
05:27:00 --> 05:27:03
<v MR. UDALL>I was present at the opening of

6303
05:27:03 --> 05:27:05
<v MR. UDALL>the new mexico state legislature

6304
05:27:05 --> 05:27:08
<v MR. UDALL>last month when ben informed us

6305
05:27:08 --> 05:27:09
<v MR. UDALL>of his illness, an illness that

6306
05:27:09 --> 05:27:10
<v MR. UDALL>left him weakened but not

6307
05:27:10 --> 05:27:11
<v MR. UDALL>defeated.

6308
05:27:11 --> 05:27:14
<v MR. UDALL>Like everyone in that room, I

6309
05:27:14 --> 05:27:16
<v MR. UDALL>was deeply saddened at the news

6310
05:27:16 --> 05:27:18
<v MR. UDALL>of ben's illness, but that

6311
05:27:18 --> 05:27:20
<v MR. UDALL>sorrow is tempered by

6312
05:27:20 --> 05:27:22
<v MR. UDALL>admiration, admiration for

6313
05:27:22 --> 05:27:24
<v MR. UDALL>been, for carmen, for the

6314
05:27:24 --> 05:27:25
<v MR. UDALL>entire lujan family and for the

6315
05:27:25 --> 05:27:26
<v MR. UDALL>incredible strength they have

6316
05:27:26 --> 05:27:28
<v MR. UDALL>shown.

6317
05:27:28 --> 05:27:30
<v MR. UDALL>He would not allow a terrible

6318
05:27:30 --> 05:27:31
<v MR. UDALL>illness to distract from his

6319
05:27:31 --> 05:27:33
<v MR. UDALL>duties as speaker of the house.

6320
05:27:33 --> 05:27:35
<v MR. UDALL>He remains steadfast in his

6321
05:27:35 --> 05:27:37
<v MR. UDALL>services to the people of new

6322
05:27:37 --> 05:27:39
<v MR. UDALL>mexico, and even while

6323
05:27:39 --> 05:27:41
<v MR. UDALL>undergoing chemotherapy, he

6324
05:27:41 --> 05:27:43
<v MR. UDALL>continued to work as speaker.

6325
05:27:43 --> 05:27:45
<v MR. UDALL>Even a devastating illness could

6326
05:27:45 --> 05:27:47
<v MR. UDALL>not deter ben lujan from the job

6327
05:27:47 --> 05:27:49
<v MR. UDALL>he had committed to do.

6328
05:27:49 --> 05:27:52
<v MR. UDALL>And his family supported him

6329
05:27:52 --> 05:27:55
<v MR. UDALL>every step of the way.

6330
05:27:55 --> 05:27:56
<v MR. UDALL>That is honor, that is

6331
05:27:56 --> 05:27:58
<v MR. UDALL>integrity, that is courage.

6332
05:27:58 --> 05:28:00
<v MR. UDALL>none of us will ever forget

6333
05:28:00 --> 05:28:03
<v MR. UDALL>ben's brave words the last --

6334
05:28:03 --> 05:28:04
<v MR. UDALL>the day last month.

6335
05:28:04 --> 05:28:07
<v MR. UDALL>He said -- quote -- &quot;while this

6336
05:28:07 --> 05:28:08
<v MR. UDALL>has taken a toll on me

6337
05:28:08 --> 05:28:11
<v MR. UDALL>physically, it has not broken

6338
05:28:11 --> 05:28:14
<v MR. UDALL>my spirit, my will, my faith,

6339
05:28:14 --> 05:28:16
<v MR. UDALL>and my commitment to new

6340
05:28:16 --> 05:28:17
<v MR. UDALL>mexico&quot; -- end quote about so to

6341
05:28:17 --> 05:28:19
<v MR. UDALL>ben I want to say thank you,

<v MR. UDALL>of new mexico, I will close

6347
05:28:30 --> 05:28:33
<v MR. UDALL>with these lines from the poet

<v MR. UDALL>lord alfred tennyson.

<v MR. UDALL>Though much is taken, much

6350
05:28:36 --> 05:28:38
<v MR. UDALL>abides and though we are not now

6351
05:28:38 --> 05:28:40
<v MR. UDALL>that strength which in the old

<v MR. UDALL>strong in will to strive, to

6357
05:28:53 --> 05:28:53

<v MR. MCCONNELL>much he was 23 years old.

6389
05:52:06 --> 05:52:09

<v MR. MCCONNELL>Sergeant ray knew the risk of

<v MR. MCCONNELL>army service and faced them

6410
05:52:58 --> 05:53:01
<v MR. MCCONNELL>squarely without flinching.

6411
05:53:01 --> 05:53:03
<v MR. MCCONNELL>In fact, a reporter embedded

6412
05:53:03 --> 05:53:06

<v MR. MCCONNELL>kandahar connecting to major

6420
05:53:22 --> 05:53:25
<v MR. MCCONNELL>cities like kabul.

6421
05:53:25 --> 05:53:27
<v MR. MCCONNELL>people ask me if I regret

6422
05:53:27 --> 05:53:30
<v MR. MCCONNELL>letting adam join, says his

6423
05:53:30 --> 05:53:34
<v MR. MCCONNELL>mother, donna ray.

6424
05:53:34 --> 05:53:36
<v MR. MCCONNELL>Well, I don't.

6425
05:53:36 --> 05:53:38
<v MR. MCCONNELL>Adam died doing what he loved

6426
05:53:38 --> 05:53:38
<v MR. MCCONNELL>more than anything else in the

6427
05:53:38 --> 05:53:40
<v MR. MCCONNELL>world.

6428
05:53:40 --> 05:53:41
<v MR. MCCONNELL>No, adam did not go into this

6429
05:53:41 --> 05:53:42
<v MR. MCCONNELL>wanting to die for his country,

6430
05:53:42 --> 05:53:44
<v MR. MCCONNELL>but he was more than willing to

6431
05:53:44 --> 05:53:47
<v MR. MCCONNELL>do it.

6432
05:53:47 --> 05:53:49
<v MR. MCCONNELL>I am so very honored to be his

6433
05:53:49 --> 05:53:52
<v MR. MCCONNELL>mother and to tell everyone

6434
05:53:52 --> 05:53:56
<v MR. MCCONNELL>about him.

6435
05:53:56 --> 05:53:58
<v MR. MCCONNELL>Adam ray was born March 9, 1986,

6436
05:53:58 --> 05:53:59
<v MR. MCCONNELL>to jim and donna ray.

6437
05:53:59 --> 05:54:01
<v MR. MCCONNELL>When adam was in I think third

6438
05:54:01 --> 05:54:05
<v MR. MCCONNELL>grade, he went on a school field

6439
05:54:05 --> 05:54:07
<v MR. MCCONNELL>trip to a military museum.

6440
05:54:07 --> 05:54:09
<v MR. MCCONNELL>From that moment on, he wanted

6441
05:54:09 --> 05:54:11
<v MR. MCCONNELL>to be a soldier.

6442
05:54:11 --> 05:54:13
<v MR. MCCONNELL>He would play army with his

6443
05:54:13 --> 05:54:15
<v MR. MCCONNELL>little toy soldiers in the

6444
05:54:15 --> 05:54:16
<v MR. MCCONNELL>bathtub, remembers donna.

6445
05:54:16 --> 05:54:19
<v MR. MCCONNELL>He lined them up around the edge

6446
05:54:19 --> 05:54:21
<v MR. MCCONNELL>of the tub and prepared for the

6447
05:54:22 --> 05:54:23
<v MR. MCCONNELL>attack of his dinosaurs.

6448
05:54:24 --> 05:54:27
<v MR. MCCONNELL>at night when I tucked him into

6449
05:54:27 --> 05:54:32
<v MR. MCCONNELL>his bed, I would have to pry the

6450
05:54:32 --> 05:54:33
<v MR. MCCONNELL>toy soldiers out of his clinched

6451
05:54:33 --> 05:54:35
<v MR. MCCONNELL>fists.

6452
05:54:35 --> 05:54:38
<v MR. MCCONNELL>Adam's father jim attended west

6453
05:54:38 --> 05:54:42
<v MR. MCCONNELL>point and adam wanted to follow

6454
05:54:42 --> 05:54:43
<v MR. MCCONNELL>had his footprints and also go

6455
05:54:43 --> 05:54:46
<v MR. MCCONNELL>there himself.

6456
05:54:46 --> 05:54:49
<v MR. MCCONNELL>after the attacks of 9/11, adam

6457
05:54:49 --> 05:54:49
<v MR. MCCONNELL>felt an urgency to serve his

6458
05:54:49 --> 05:54:51
<v MR. MCCONNELL>country.

6459
05:54:51 --> 05:54:53
<v MR. MCCONNELL>He entered military service in

6460
05:54:53 --> 05:54:56

6461
05:54:56 --> 05:54:57
<v MR. MCCONNELL>basic combat training at

6463
05:55:00 --> 05:55:01

<v MR. MCCONNELL>trained as a patient

6467
05:55:07 --> 05:55:10

6468
05:55:10 --> 05:55:11
<v MR. MCCONNELL>His first deployment was to camp

6469
05:55:11 --> 05:55:13
<v MR. MCCONNELL>casey, korea.

6470
05:55:13 --> 05:55:15
<v MR. MCCONNELL>After one year in korea, adam

6471
05:55:15 --> 05:55:17
<v MR. MCCONNELL>reenlist and was transferred to

6472
05:55:17 --> 05:55:19

6473
05:55:19 --> 05:55:22
<v MR. MCCONNELL>By the time he was deployed to

6474

<v MR. MCCONNELL>joint base louis Mccord,

<v MR. MCCONNELL>washington.

6480
05:55:37 --> 05:55:37
<v MR. MCCONNELL>In early 2009, adwams deployed

6481
05:55:37 --> 05:55:40
<v MR. MCCONNELL>to afghanistan.

6482
05:55:40 --> 05:55:41
<v MR. MCCONNELL>He visited his family while on

6483
05:55:41 --> 05:55:45
<v MR. MCCONNELL>leave in September of that year

6484
05:55:45 --> 05:55:45
<v MR. MCCONNELL>and returned to afghanistan in

6485
05:55:45 --> 05:55:48
<v MR. MCCONNELL>October.

6486
05:55:48 --> 05:55:50
<v MR. MCCONNELL>By christmas, his family was

6487
05:55:50 --> 05:55:51
<v MR. MCCONNELL>hearing less from him because he

6488
05:55:51 --> 05:55:53
<v MR. MCCONNELL>was preparing for a dangerous

6489
05:55:53 --> 05:55:55
<v MR. MCCONNELL>mission.

6490
05:55:55 --> 05:55:57
<v MR. MCCONNELL>The friday before he was killed,

6491
05:55:57 --> 05:55:58
<v MR. MCCONNELL>he called about 2:00 A.M. Our

6492
05:55:58 --> 05:56:01
<v MR. MCCONNELL>time.

6493
05:56:01 --> 05:56:02
<v MR. MCCONNELL>He always forgot about the time

6494
05:56:02 --> 05:56:04
<v MR. MCCONNELL>difference, donna remembers.

6495
05:56:04 --> 05:56:06
<v MR. MCCONNELL>He told me that his unit was

6496
05:56:06 --> 05:56:07
<v MR. MCCONNELL>moving and that I May not hear

6497
05:56:07 --> 05:56:10
<v MR. MCCONNELL>prosecute him for a while and

6498
05:56:10 --> 05:56:14
<v MR. MCCONNELL>hot to worry.

6499
05:56:14 --> 05:56:15
<v MR. MCCONNELL>A few days later came the

6500
05:56:15 --> 05:56:18
<v MR. MCCONNELL>fateful tuesday that was

6501
05:56:18 --> 05:56:21
<v MR. MCCONNELL>February the 9th.

6502
05:56:21 --> 05:56:26
<v MR. MCCONNELL>Adam's unit was conducting

6503
05:56:26 --> 05:56:29
<v MR. MCCONNELL>culvert denial in an area where

6504
05:56:29 --> 05:56:31
<v MR. MCCONNELL>an afghan soldier was killed in

6505
05:56:31 --> 05:56:32
<v MR. MCCONNELL>a culvert underneath a road.

6506
05:56:32 --> 05:56:35
<v MR. MCCONNELL>At approximately 9:30 A.M., the

6507
05:56:35 --> 05:56:36

05:57:34 --> 05:57:36
<v MR. MCCONNELL>I know my colleagues join me in

6532
05:57:36 --> 05:57:37
<v MR. MCCONNELL>extending the sincere and

6533
05:57:37 --> 05:57:39

6536
05:57:44 --> 05:57:48
<v MR. MCCONNELL>We have set aside this moment to

05:57:48 --> 05:57:51
<v MR. MCCONNELL>recognize his service, service

6538
05:57:51 --> 05:57:54

<v MR. MCCONNELL>sacrifice.

6542
05:58:01 --> 05:58:03
<v MR. MCCONNELL>Madam President, I suggest the

6543
05:58:03 --> 05:58:04
<v MR. MCCONNELL>absence of a quorum.

6544
05:58:04 --> 05:58:06
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

6545
05:58:06 --> 05:58:07
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>clerk will call the roll.

6546
05:59:07 --> 05:59:08
<v MR. WARNER>Madam President

6547
05:59:08 --> 05:59:08
<v MR. WARNER>in.

6548
05:59:09 --> 05:59:10
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

6549
05:59:10 --> 05:59:11
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senator from virginia.

6550
05:59:12 --> 05:59:13
<v MR. WARNER>are we in a

6551
05:59:13 --> 05:59:13
<v MR. WARNER>quorum?

6552
05:59:13 --> 05:59:14
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>yes.

6553
05:59:14 --> 05:59:15
<v MR. WARNER>skilled that the

6554
05:59:15 --> 05:59:15
<v MR. WARNER>proceedings of the quorum be

6555
05:59:15 --> 05:59:16
<v MR. WARNER>dispensed with.

6556
05:59:16 --> 05:59:16
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

6557
05:59:16 --> 05:59:17
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

6558
05:59:17 --> 05:59:19
<v MR. WARNER>I ask unanimous

6559
05:59:19 --> 05:59:20
<v MR. WARNER>consent to peek for up to ten

6560
05:59:20 --> 05:59:22
<v MR. WARNER>minutes -- to speak for up to

6561
05:59:22 --> 05:59:22
<v MR. WARNER>ten minutes as if in morning

6562
05:59:22 --> 05:59:23
<v MR. WARNER>business.

6563
05:59:23 --> 05:59:24
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

6564
05:59:24 --> 05:59:25
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

6565
05:59:26 --> 05:59:31
<v MR. WARNER>Madam President,

6566
05:59:31 --> 05:59:34
<v MR. WARNER>let me rise today to speak about

6567
05:59:35 --> 05:59:36
<v MR. WARNER>the conference report that

6568
05:59:36 --> 05:59:38
<v MR. WARNER>appears that will

6569
05:59:38 --> 05:59:39
<v MR. WARNER>that we'll be voting on

6570
05:59:39 --> 05:59:41
<v MR. WARNER>tomorrow regarding the issues of

6571
05:59:41 --> 05:59:42
<v MR. WARNER>the payroll tax, unimhoiment

6572
05:59:42 --> 05:59:44
<v MR. WARNER>benefits and the so-called doc

6573
05:59:44 --> 05:59:48
<v MR. WARNER>fix.

6574
05:59:48 --> 05:59:50
<v MR. WARNER>And let me first of all

6575
05:59:50 --> 05:59:55
<v MR. WARNER>acknowledge, Mr. President, that

6576
05:59:55 --> 05:59:58
<v MR. WARNER>I know that many of my

6577
05:59:58 --> 06:00:00
<v MR. WARNER>colleagues have worked long

6578
06:00:00 --> 06:00:03
<v MR. WARNER>hours on the payroll tax deal

6579
06:00:03 --> 06:00:07
<v MR. WARNER>that was apparently reached late

6580
06:00:07 --> 06:00:09
<v MR. WARNER>last night.

6581
06:00:09 --> 06:00:11
<v MR. WARNER>I have been briefed on pieces of

6582
06:00:11 --> 06:00:15
<v MR. WARNER>this deal, and I've also seen

6583
06:00:15 --> 06:00:18
<v MR. WARNER>many of the press reports that

6584
06:00:18 --> 06:00:21
<v MR. WARNER>have described this deal as a

6585
06:00:21 --> 06:00:21
<v MR. WARNER>new sign of bipartisanship.

6586
06:00:21 --> 06:00:23
<v MR. WARNER>It

6587
06:00:23 --> 06:00:26
<v MR. WARNER>as a new member of the senate, I

6588
06:00:26 --> 06:00:27
<v MR. WARNER>know, like the presiding

6589
06:00:27 --> 06:00:31
<v MR. WARNER>officer, we believe that we do

6590
06:00:31 --> 06:00:33
<v MR. WARNER>our best work here in congress

6591
06:00:33 --> 06:00:37
<v MR. WARNER>when we can't

6592
06:00:37 --> 06:00:38
<v MR. WARNER>we can have bipartisan

6593
06:00:38 --> 06:00:39
<v MR. WARNER>solutions, when we can find way

6594
06:00:39 --> 06:00:42
<v MR. WARNER>to reach common ground.

6595
06:00:42 --> 06:00:43
<v MR. WARNER>All these factors make it doubly

6596
06:00:43 --> 06:00:46
<v MR. WARNER>difficult for me to now rise and

6597
06:00:46 --> 06:00:48
<v MR. WARNER>say that I will be voting

6598
06:00:48 --> 06:00:49
<v MR. WARNER>against the conference report

6599
06:00:49 --> 06:00:52
<v MR. WARNER>when it comes to the floor of

6600
06:00:52 --> 06:00:54
<v MR. WARNER>this body tomorrow.

6601
06:00:54 --> 06:00:58
<v MR. WARNER>Now, let me acknowledge on the

6602
06:00:58 --> 06:01:01
<v MR. WARNER>front end that I think there are

6603
06:01:01 --> 06:01:02
<v MR. WARNER>worthy reasons that this

6604
06:01:02 --> 06:01:06
<v MR. WARNER>recovering economy we've got

6605
06:01:06 --> 06:01:08
<v MR. WARNER>right now to maintain in some

6606
06:01:08 --> 06:01:09
<v MR. WARNER>form the payroll -- so-called

6607
06:01:09 --> 06:01:14
<v MR. WARNER>payroll tax holiday for a

6608
06:01:14 --> 06:01:17
<v MR. WARNER>limited period of time.

6609
06:01:17 --> 06:01:21
<v MR. WARNER>But I also think it's important

6610
06:01:21 --> 06:01:22
<v MR. WARNER>that we bear this short-term

6611
06:01:22 --> 06:01:24
<v MR. WARNER>stimulative item in the context

6612
06:01:24 --> 06:01:26
<v MR. WARNER>of a series of other items.

6613
06:01:26 --> 06:01:28
<v MR. WARNER>I know and the presiding officer

6614
06:01:28 --> 06:01:29
<v MR. WARNER>feel that one of the most

6615
06:01:29 --> 06:01:31
<v MR. WARNER>important issues that our

6616
06:01:31 --> 06:01:32
<v MR. WARNER>country confronts right now, i

6617
06:01:32 --> 06:01:35
<v MR. WARNER>would say the most important

6618
06:01:35 --> 06:01:36
<v MR. WARNER>issue and the one that is an

6619
06:01:36 --> 06:01:38
<v MR. WARNER>overhang on everything else we

6620
06:01:38 --> 06:01:43
<v MR. WARNER>debate is our inability to come

6621
06:01:43 --> 06:01:43
<v MR. WARNER>to grips with our debt and

6622
06:01:43 --> 06:01:47
<v MR. WARNER>deficit.

6623
06:01:47 --> 06:01:48
<v MR. WARNER>I know as we try to nurture this

6624
06:01:48 --> 06:01:50
<v MR. WARNER>growing recovery, that one of

6625
06:01:50 --> 06:01:52
<v MR. WARNER>the ways we take on that debt

6626
06:01:52 --> 06:01:53
<v MR. WARNER>and deficit is by having a

6627
06:01:53 --> 06:01:57
<v MR. WARNER>growing economy.

6628
06:01:57 --> 06:01:58
<v MR. WARNER>But I also believe that it is

6629
06:01:58 --> 06:02:01
<v MR. WARNER>terribly important that we show

6630
06:02:01 --> 06:02:04
<v MR. WARNER>progress on this issue.

6631
06:02:04 --> 06:02:05
<v MR. WARNER>The national debt now exceeds

6632
06:02:05 --> 06:02:08
<v MR. WARNER>$15 trillion.

6633
06:02:08 --> 06:02:11
<v MR. WARNER>Every day that we fail to act we

6634
06:02:11 --> 06:02:14
<v MR. WARNER>add $4 billion to that total.

6635
06:02:14 --> 06:02:15
<v MR. WARNER>none of this becomes self

6636
06:02:15 --> 06:02:16
<v MR. WARNER>corrective.

6637
06:02:16 --> 06:02:18
<v MR. WARNER>It will not correct itself until

6638
06:02:18 --> 06:02:19
<v MR. WARNER>and unless we act.

6639
06:02:19 --> 06:02:22
<v MR. WARNER>And I for one believe that there

6640
06:02:22 --> 06:02:25
<v MR. WARNER>is no action that this body

6641
06:02:25 --> 06:02:28
<v MR. WARNER>could take that would be more

6642
06:02:28 --> 06:02:32
<v MR. WARNER>stimulative to our economy, that

6643
06:02:32 --> 06:02:33
<v MR. WARNER>would be a better jobs program,

6644
06:02:33 --> 06:02:35
<v MR. WARNER>that would do more to restore

6645
06:02:35 --> 06:02:39
<v MR. WARNER>the trust of the business

6646
06:02:39 --> 06:02:41
<v MR. WARNER>community and the public when we

6647
06:02:41 --> 06:02:44
<v MR. WARNER>show bipartisan collaboration

6648
06:02:44 --> 06:02:45
<v MR. WARNER>and cooperation on a long-term

6649
06:02:45 --> 06:02:47
<v MR. WARNER>debt and deficit deal.

6650
06:02:47 --> 06:02:49
<v MR. WARNER>So let me share with my

6651
06:02:49 --> 06:02:52
<v MR. WARNER>colleagues the five reasons why

6652
06:02:52 --> 06:02:55
<v MR. WARNER>i will be voting against the

6653
06:02:55 --> 06:02:59
<v MR. WARNER>conference report tomorrow.

6654
06:02:59 --> 06:03:03
<v MR. WARNER>First and foremost, the payroll

6655
06:03:03 --> 06:03:04
<v MR. WARNER>tax cut that's been proposed

6656
06:03:04 --> 06:03:08
<v MR. WARNER>isn't being paid for.

6657
06:03:08 --> 06:03:09
<v MR. WARNER>It will add $100 billion to the

6658
06:03:09 --> 06:03:12
<v MR. WARNER>debt.

6659
06:03:12 --> 06:03:15
<v MR. WARNER>second, the compromise that has

6660
06:03:15 --> 06:03:16
<v MR. WARNER>been put together, I think,

6661
06:03:16 --> 06:03:20
<v MR. WARNER>turns some of our traditional

6662
06:03:20 --> 06:03:23
<v MR. WARNER>policies on their head.

6663
06:03:23 --> 06:03:24
<v MR. WARNER>By taking this action, we're

6664
06:03:24 --> 06:03:27
<v MR. WARNER>saying that tax cuts somehow

6665
06:03:27 --> 06:03:29
<v MR. WARNER>don't have to be paid for.

6666
06:03:29 --> 06:03:32
<v MR. WARNER>We're advancing a policy that I

6667
06:03:32 --> 06:03:34
<v MR. WARNER>believe will come back to haunt

6668
06:03:34 --> 06:03:37
<v MR. WARNER>us later this year when the bush

6669
06:03:37 --> 06:03:41
<v MR. WARNER>tax cuts expire.

6670
06:03:41 --> 06:03:42
<v MR. WARNER>As a matter of fact, while I am

6671
06:03:42 --> 06:03:44
<v MR. WARNER>only a member this have body for

6672
06:03:44 --> 06:03:45
<v MR. WARNER>three years, I know it has been

6673
06:03:45 --> 06:03:46
<v MR. WARNER>tradition that in moments of

6674
06:03:46 --> 06:03:48
<v MR. WARNER>economic crisis that the

6675
06:03:48 --> 06:03:49
<v MR. WARNER>congress will sometimes extend

6676
06:03:49 --> 06:03:50
<v MR. WARNER>unemployment benefits,

6677
06:03:50 --> 06:03:51
<v MR. WARNER>particularly for those states

6678
06:03:51 --> 06:03:53
<v MR. WARNER>that have been hardest hit.

6679
06:03:53 --> 06:03:55
<v MR. WARNER>and in those moments of crisis,

6680
06:03:55 --> 06:03:59
<v MR. WARNER>the unemployment benefits

6681
06:03:59 --> 06:04:01
<v MR. WARNER>sometimes go unpaid for.

6682
06:04:01 --> 06:04:02
<v MR. WARNER>In this compromise, in this

6683
06:04:02 --> 06:04:06
<v MR. WARNER>conference report we turn that

6684
06:04:06 --> 06:04:08
<v MR. WARNER>policy on its head and there is

6685
06:04:08 --> 06:04:09
<v MR. WARNER>a requirement to pay for the

6686
06:04:09 --> 06:04:10
<v MR. WARNER>extension of unemployment

6687
06:04:10 --> 06:04:13
<v MR. WARNER>benefits but no requirement to

6688
06:04:13 --> 06:04:15
<v MR. WARNER>pay for the $100 billion of

6689
06:04:15 --> 06:04:18
<v MR. WARNER>additional debt taken on by the

6690
06:04:18 --> 06:04:24
<v MR. WARNER>payroll tax holiday.

6691
06:04:24 --> 06:04:27
<v MR. WARNER>You know, I -- knowing this body

6692
06:04:27 --> 06:04:29
<v MR. WARNER>as we've had debates about debt

6693
06:04:29 --> 06:04:30
<v MR. WARNER>and deficit and economics, we've

6694
06:04:30 --> 06:04:35
<v MR. WARNER>discussed the economic theories

6695
06:04:35 --> 06:04:35
<v MR. WARNER>of a whole host of thinkers and

6696
06:04:35 --> 06:04:41
<v MR. WARNER>economists.

6697
06:04:41 --> 06:04:44
<v MR. WARNER>John maynard keynes, milton

6698
06:04:44 --> 06:04:46
<v MR. WARNER>friedman, paul krugman.

6699
06:04:46 --> 06:04:48
<v MR. WARNER>I somehow feel like this

6700
06:04:48 --> 06:04:50
<v MR. WARNER>conference report that we'll be

6701
06:04:50 --> 06:04:54
<v MR. WARNER>voting on tomorrow May reflect

6702
06:04:54 --> 06:04:56
<v MR. WARNER>the thinking of a more obscure

6703
06:04:56 --> 06:05:02
<v MR. WARNER>individual, someone that I

6704
06:05:02 --> 06:05:09
<v MR. WARNER>recall as a child growing up,

6705
06:05:09 --> 06:05:12
<v MR. WARNER>and that was wimp kwraoerbgs who --

6706
06:05:12 --> 06:05:14
<v MR. WARNER>wimpy, a cartoon character, pop

6707
06:05:14 --> 06:05:17
<v MR. WARNER>eye's pal.

6708
06:05:17 --> 06:05:19
<v MR. WARNER>&quot;I'll gladly pay you tuesday for

6709
06:05:19 --> 06:05:20
<v MR. WARNER>a hamburger today.&quot;

6710
06:05:20 --> 06:05:22
<v MR. WARNER>well, it seems on this economic

6711
06:05:22 --> 06:05:24
<v MR. WARNER>policy we're taking today,

6712
06:05:24 --> 06:05:28
<v MR. WARNER>deferring payment for this

6713
06:05:28 --> 06:05:30
<v MR. WARNER>payroll tax policy, that wimpy

6714
06:05:30 --> 06:05:33
<v MR. WARNER>once again has won out.

6715
06:05:33 --> 06:05:35
<v MR. WARNER>Let me cite the third reason why

6716
06:05:35 --> 06:05:36
<v MR. WARNER>i'll be voting against the

6717
06:05:36 --> 06:05:38
<v MR. WARNER>conference report tomorrow.

6718
06:05:38 --> 06:05:40
<v MR. WARNER>As I acknowledged at the

6719
06:05:40 --> 06:05:42
<v MR. WARNER>beginning of my comments, I

6720
06:05:42 --> 06:05:45
<v MR. WARNER>believe extension of the payroll

6721
06:05:45 --> 06:05:47
<v MR. WARNER>tax holiday makes sense in this

6722
06:05:47 --> 06:05:48
<v MR. WARNER>economic recovery, but it just

6723
06:05:48 --> 06:05:52
<v MR. WARNER>needs to be paid for.

6724
06:05:52 --> 06:05:58
<v MR. WARNER>So I could have very easily

6725
06:05:58 --> 06:05:59
<v MR. WARNER>supported a a number of the

6726
06:05:59 --> 06:06:02
<v MR. WARNER>proposals put forward including

6727
06:06:02 --> 06:06:05
<v MR. WARNER>a 1% increase in taxes on those

6728
06:06:05 --> 06:06:06
<v MR. WARNER>of us who make more than $1

6729
06:06:06 --> 06:06:09
<v MR. WARNER>million a year.

6730
06:06:09 --> 06:06:10
<v MR. WARNER>A defined benefit with a defined

6731
06:06:10 --> 06:06:12
<v MR. WARNER>pay-for.

6732
06:06:12 --> 06:06:14
<v MR. WARNER>We couldn't breach the gap on

6733
06:06:14 --> 06:06:16
<v MR. WARNER>that, I could have looked at

6734
06:06:16 --> 06:06:17
<v MR. WARNER>means testing the payroll tax

6735
06:06:17 --> 06:06:18
<v MR. WARNER>holiday.

6736
06:06:18 --> 06:06:20
<v MR. WARNER>If we're trying to make sure

6737
06:06:20 --> 06:06:21
<v MR. WARNER>that these dollars get into the

6738
06:06:21 --> 06:06:23
<v MR. WARNER>economy as quickly as possible

6739
06:06:23 --> 06:06:25
<v MR. WARNER>over this coming year, then

6740
06:06:25 --> 06:06:28
<v MR. WARNER>clearly a payroll tax holiday

6741
06:06:28 --> 06:06:30
<v MR. WARNER>for folks who make less than

6742
06:06:30 --> 06:06:36
<v MR. WARNER>$150,000 a year or $250,000 a

6743
06:06:36 --> 06:06:38
<v MR. WARNER>year or $500,000 a year or $1

6744
06:06:38 --> 06:06:41
<v MR. WARNER>million or less a year, it

6745
06:06:41 --> 06:06:44
<v MR. WARNER>didn't make sense to say that

6746
06:06:44 --> 06:06:46
<v MR. WARNER>regardless of what your income;

6747
06:06:46 --> 06:06:48
<v MR. WARNER>this payroll tax holiday going

6748
06:06:48 --> 06:06:50
<v MR. WARNER>to folks like me is going to

6749
06:06:50 --> 06:06:51
<v MR. WARNER>have a stimulative effect, I

6750
06:06:51 --> 06:06:52
<v MR. WARNER>don't think economic theory

6751
06:06:52 --> 06:06:54
<v MR. WARNER>bears that out.

6752
06:06:54 --> 06:06:56
<v MR. WARNER>If we paid for this or put some

6753
06:06:56 --> 06:06:59
<v MR. WARNER>restraints on it, I would have

6754
06:06:59 --> 06:07:00
<v MR. WARNER>been happy to support this

6755
06:07:00 --> 06:07:01
<v MR. WARNER>conference report.

6756
06:07:01 --> 06:07:04
<v MR. WARNER>The fourth reason why I can't

6757
06:07:04 --> 06:07:06
<v MR. WARNER>support the conference report is

6758
06:07:06 --> 06:07:11
<v MR. WARNER>because I am concerned that this

6759
06:07:11 --> 06:07:12
<v MR. WARNER>payroll tax holiday which goes

6760
06:07:12 --> 06:07:15
<v MR. WARNER>in to the social security trust

6761
06:07:15 --> 06:07:20
<v MR. WARNER>fund, which takes on an area

6762
06:07:20 --> 06:07:22
<v MR. WARNER>where there has been support,

6763
06:07:22 --> 06:07:24
<v MR. WARNER>democrats, republicans only,

6764
06:07:24 --> 06:07:26
<v MR. WARNER>that the fact that we say this

6765
06:07:26 --> 06:07:28
<v MR. WARNER>payroll tax holiday will end at

6766
06:07:28 --> 06:07:32
<v MR. WARNER>the end of the year but we put

6767
06:07:32 --> 06:07:34
<v MR. WARNER>no metrics on that, it scares me

6768
06:07:34 --> 06:07:35
<v MR. WARNER>that we will approach the end of

6769
06:07:35 --> 06:07:37
<v MR. WARNER>the year and there will be some

6770
06:07:37 --> 06:07:37
<v MR. WARNER>other reason why it needs to be

6771
06:07:37 --> 06:07:39
<v MR. WARNER>extended again.

6772
06:07:39 --> 06:07:40
<v MR. WARNER>If we put in place a requirement

6773
06:07:40 --> 06:07:42
<v MR. WARNER>that would have said this

6774
06:07:42 --> 06:07:43
<v MR. WARNER>payroll tax holiday would start

6775
06:07:43 --> 06:07:45
<v MR. WARNER>to ratchet back if we continue

6776
06:07:45 --> 06:07:47
<v MR. WARNER>to see growth in the economy,

6777
06:07:47 --> 06:07:49
<v MR. WARNER>perhaps ratchet back a third if

6778
06:07:49 --> 06:07:50
<v MR. WARNER>we see G.D.P. Growth for the

6779
06:07:50 --> 06:07:52
<v MR. WARNER>next three months or

6780
06:07:52 --> 06:07:54
<v MR. WARNER>unemployment growth.

6781
06:07:54 --> 06:07:55
<v MR. WARNER>Ratchet back another third,

6782
06:07:55 --> 06:07:56
<v MR. WARNER>ratchet back another third, so

6783
06:07:56 --> 06:07:58
<v MR. WARNER>we don't have the cliff effect

6784
06:07:58 --> 06:07:59
<v MR. WARNER>that is being proposed at the

6785
06:07:59 --> 06:08:00
<v MR. WARNER>end of the year.

6786
06:08:00 --> 06:08:03
<v MR. WARNER>Again, a cliff effect that will

6787
06:08:03 --> 06:08:05
<v MR. WARNER>come at the same time as the end

6788
06:08:05 --> 06:08:08
<v MR. WARNER>of the bush tax cuts, the

6789
06:08:08 --> 06:08:11
<v MR. WARNER>imposition of the so-called $1.2

6790
06:08:11 --> 06:08:13
<v MR. WARNER>trillion sequester cuts.

6791
06:08:14 --> 06:08:15
<v MR. WARNER>And the proverbial train wreck

6792
06:08:15 --> 06:08:15
<v MR. WARNER>that's already being talked

6793
06:08:15 --> 06:08:18
<v MR. WARNER>about.

6794
06:08:18 --> 06:08:23
<v MR. WARNER>so while I believe that this

6795
06:08:23 --> 06:08:27
<v MR. WARNER>payroll tax holiday is

6796
06:08:27 --> 06:08:30
<v MR. WARNER>important, the price, the fact

6797
06:08:30 --> 06:08:32
<v MR. WARNER>that we aren't paying for it,

6798
06:08:32 --> 06:08:36
<v MR. WARNER>the fact we put no restrictions

6799
06:08:36 --> 06:08:37
<v MR. WARNER>or parameters around it and the

6800
06:08:37 --> 06:08:40
<v MR. WARNER>guarantee -- no guarantee that

6801
06:08:40 --> 06:08:43
<v MR. WARNER>it will actually expire are

6802
06:08:43 --> 06:08:45
<v MR. WARNER>reasons why I'll be voting &quot;no.&quot;

6803
06:08:45 --> 06:08:47
<v MR. WARNER>let me raise one other concern I

6804
06:08:47 --> 06:08:48
<v MR. WARNER>have about the conference

6805
06:08:48 --> 06:08:53
<v MR. WARNER>report.

6806
06:08:53 --> 06:08:54
<v MR. WARNER>This is one more example of,

6807
06:08:54 --> 06:08:57
<v MR. WARNER>particular our colleagues in

6808
06:08:57 --> 06:09:01
<v MR. WARNER>the house saying the first place

6809
06:09:01 --> 06:09:04
<v MR. WARNER>they go for any pay-for, for any

6810
06:09:04 --> 06:09:05
<v MR. WARNER>project seems to be our federal

6811
06:09:05 --> 06:09:07
<v MR. WARNER>workers.

6812
06:09:07 --> 06:09:09
<v MR. WARNER>The same federal workers,

6813
06:09:09 --> 06:09:12
<v MR. WARNER>tkhroes two million -- close to

6814
06:09:12 --> 06:09:15
<v MR. WARNER>two million strong, who keep our

6815
06:09:15 --> 06:09:16
<v MR. WARNER>streets safe, make sure we get

6816
06:09:16 --> 06:09:19
<v MR. WARNER>those social security checks,

6817
06:09:19 --> 06:09:19
<v MR. WARNER>try to take out terrorist drug

6818
06:09:19 --> 06:09:22
<v MR. WARNER>dealers.

6819
06:09:22 --> 06:09:24
<v MR. WARNER>You name it, the same federal

6820
06:09:24 --> 06:09:25
<v MR. WARNER>workers who have had their pay

6821
06:09:25 --> 06:09:30
<v MR. WARNER>frozen for the last two years,

6822
06:09:30 --> 06:09:32
<v MR. WARNER>who have had to endure the

6823
06:09:32 --> 06:09:32
<v MR. WARNER>prospects of two or three

6824
06:09:32 --> 06:09:37
<v MR. WARNER>potential government shutdowns

6825
06:09:37 --> 06:09:39
<v MR. WARNER>over the last year and a half.

6826
06:09:39 --> 06:09:41
<v MR. WARNER>to say to this group we're going

6827
06:09:41 --> 06:09:42
<v MR. WARNER>to come back to the well time

6828
06:09:42 --> 06:09:43
<v MR. WARNER>and time again, I don't think is

6829
06:09:43 --> 06:09:45
<v MR. WARNER>fair or right.

6830
06:09:45 --> 06:09:48
<v MR. WARNER>I know as someone who's looked

6831
06:09:48 --> 06:09:52
<v MR. WARNER>at the federal pay and benefits,

6832
06:09:52 --> 06:09:53
<v MR. WARNER>when we get to that issue of a

6833
06:09:53 --> 06:09:56
<v MR. WARNER>comprehensive tax reform,

6834
06:09:56 --> 06:09:58
<v MR. WARNER>entitlement reform, big deficit

6835
06:09:58 --> 06:09:58
<v MR. WARNER>deal, all these items need to be

6836
06:09:58 --> 06:10:00
<v MR. WARNER>reviewed.

6837
06:10:00 --> 06:10:02
<v MR. WARNER>But the notion that the first

6838
06:10:02 --> 06:10:04
<v MR. WARNER>place to come back to for any

6839
06:10:04 --> 06:10:06
<v MR. WARNER>pay-for is our federal

6840
06:10:06 --> 06:10:08
<v MR. WARNER>employees, to me, doesn't seem

6841
06:10:08 --> 06:10:12
<v MR. WARNER>fair, nor does it seem right.

6842
06:10:12 --> 06:10:14
<v MR. WARNER>For these five reasons, I will

6843
06:10:14 --> 06:10:16
<v MR. WARNER>reluctantly be voting against

6844
06:10:16 --> 06:10:20
<v MR. WARNER>the conference report tomorrow.

6845
06:10:20 --> 06:10:25
<v MR. WARNER>i believe it was in the context

6846
06:10:25 --> 06:10:27
<v MR. WARNER>of the debt and deficit

6847
06:10:27 --> 06:10:29
<v MR. WARNER>particularly, it was will rogers

6848
06:10:29 --> 06:10:31
<v MR. WARNER>who said when you find yourself

6849
06:10:31 --> 06:10:33
<v MR. WARNER>in a hole and you want to get

6850
06:10:33 --> 06:10:35
<v MR. WARNER>out, stop digging.

6851
06:10:35 --> 06:10:37
<v MR. WARNER>Well, in some small way by

6852
06:10:37 --> 06:10:39
<v MR. WARNER>voting &quot;no&quot; tomorrow I hope I'll

6853
06:10:39 --> 06:10:41
<v MR. WARNER>send the signal that I and I

6854
06:10:41 --> 06:10:42
<v MR. WARNER>hope others will join me and

6855
06:10:42 --> 06:10:43
<v MR. WARNER>stop digging.

6856
06:10:43 --> 06:10:45
<v MR. WARNER>With that, Mr. President, I

6857
06:10:45 --> 06:10:49
<v MR. WARNER>yield the floor and note the

6858
06:10:49 --> 06:10:50
<v MR. WARNER>absence of a quorum.

6859
06:10:50 --> 06:10:51
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>will

6860
06:10:51 --> 06:10:53
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>you withhold your request,

6861
06:10:53 --> 06:10:56
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>circumstance on that quorum?

6862
06:10:56 --> 06:10:57
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>The senator from wyoming.

6863
06:10:57 --> 06:10:58
<v MR. ENZI>thank you,

6864
06:10:58 --> 06:11:01
<v MR. ENZI>Mr. President.

6865
06:11:01 --> 06:11:02
<v MR. ENZI>i rise today after introducing a

6866
06:11:02 --> 06:11:04
<v MR. ENZI>congressional review act

6867
06:11:04 --> 06:11:06
<v MR. ENZI>resolution of disapproval to

6868
06:11:06 --> 06:11:08
<v MR. ENZI>stop the national labor

6869
06:11:08 --> 06:11:11
<v MR. ENZI>relations board's unfair and

6870
06:11:11 --> 06:11:12
<v MR. ENZI>unnecessary ambush elections

6871
06:11:12 --> 06:11:14
<v MR. ENZI>rule.

6872
06:11:14 --> 06:11:17
<v MR. ENZI>It's senate joint resolution 36.

6873
06:11:17 --> 06:11:18
<v MR. ENZI>And I'm pleased that 43 fellow

6874
06:11:18 --> 06:11:20
<v MR. ENZI>senators cosponsored this

6875
06:11:20 --> 06:11:21
<v MR. ENZI>resolution, and I know we'll

6876
06:11:21 --> 06:11:22
<v MR. ENZI>draw more support on the floor

6877
06:11:22 --> 06:11:24
<v MR. ENZI>as people learn about the

6878
06:11:24 --> 06:11:28
<v MR. ENZI>details of this new rule.

6879
06:11:28 --> 06:11:29
<v MR. ENZI>This administration's national

6880
06:11:29 --> 06:11:31
<v MR. ENZI>labor relations board has done a

6881
06:11:31 --> 06:11:33
<v MR. ENZI>lot of controversial things, but

6882
06:11:33 --> 06:11:36
<v MR. ENZI>the ambush election rule stands

6883
06:11:36 --> 06:11:38
<v MR. ENZI>out because it's a politicized

6884
06:11:38 --> 06:11:39
<v MR. ENZI>and unjustified effort to make a

6885
06:11:39 --> 06:11:41
<v MR. ENZI>fair system unfair for one side

6886
06:11:41 --> 06:11:44
<v MR. ENZI>and it's being rushed into

6887
06:11:44 --> 06:11:44
<v MR. ENZI>effect over tremendous

6888
06:11:44 --> 06:11:46
<v MR. ENZI>objection.

6889
06:11:46 --> 06:11:47
<v MR. ENZI>You May call it the national

6890
06:11:47 --> 06:11:50
<v MR. ENZI>labor relations board because

6891
06:11:50 --> 06:11:51
<v MR. ENZI>it's supposed to act in a fair

6892
06:11:51 --> 06:11:51
<v MR. ENZI>way.

6893
06:11:51 --> 06:11:53
<v MR. ENZI>The national labor relations

6894
06:11:53 --> 06:11:55
<v MR. ENZI>act, which is the national labor

6895
06:11:55 --> 06:11:56
<v MR. ENZI>relations board enforces, is a

6896
06:11:56 --> 06:11:59
<v MR. ENZI>carefully balanced law that

6897
06:11:59 --> 06:12:00
<v MR. ENZI>protects the rights of

6898
06:12:00 --> 06:12:01
<v MR. ENZI>employees.

6899
06:12:01 --> 06:12:03
<v MR. ENZI>Fairness to employees to join or

6900
06:12:03 --> 06:12:05
<v MR. ENZI>not join a union.

6901
06:12:05 --> 06:12:08
<v MR. ENZI>And also protects the rights of

6902
06:12:08 --> 06:12:09
<v MR. ENZI>employers to free speech and

6903
06:12:09 --> 06:12:12
<v MR. ENZI>unrestricted flow of commerce.

6904
06:12:12 --> 06:12:13
<v MR. ENZI>Since it was enacted in 1935,

6905
06:12:13 --> 06:12:13
<v MR. ENZI>changes to this statute have

6906
06:12:13 --> 06:12:15
<v MR. ENZI>been rare.

6907
06:12:15 --> 06:12:17
<v MR. ENZI>When they do occur, it's the

6908
06:12:17 --> 06:12:19
<v MR. ENZI>result of careful negotiations

6909
06:12:19 --> 06:12:21
<v MR. ENZI>with all stakeholders.

6910
06:12:21 --> 06:12:23
<v MR. ENZI>most of the questions have come

6911
06:12:23 --> 06:12:25
<v MR. ENZI>up under the law are handled

6912
06:12:25 --> 06:12:27
<v MR. ENZI>through decisions of the board

6913
06:12:27 --> 06:12:29
<v MR. ENZI>or decisions often do change the

6914
06:12:29 --> 06:12:30
<v MR. ENZI>enforcement of the law

6915
06:12:30 --> 06:12:32
<v MR. ENZI>significantly, but they're

6916
06:12:32 --> 06:12:34
<v MR. ENZI>issued in response to an actual

6917
06:12:34 --> 06:12:34
<v MR. ENZI>dispute, an actual question of

6918
06:12:34 --> 06:12:36
<v MR. ENZI>law.

6919
06:12:36 --> 06:12:39
<v MR. ENZI>In contrast, the ambush election

6920
06:12:39 --> 06:12:40
<v MR. ENZI>rule is not a response to a real

6921
06:12:40 --> 06:12:42
<v MR. ENZI>issue because the current

6922
06:12:42 --> 06:12:45
<v MR. ENZI>election process for certifying

6923
06:12:45 --> 06:12:47
<v MR. ENZI>whether employees want to form a

6924
06:12:47 --> 06:12:49
<v MR. ENZI>union is not broken.

6925
06:12:49 --> 06:12:51
<v MR. ENZI>This rule was not carefully

6926
06:12:51 --> 06:12:53
<v MR. ENZI>negotiated by stakeholders.

6927
06:12:53 --> 06:12:56
<v MR. ENZI>Instead it was rushed into place

6928
06:12:56 --> 06:12:59
<v MR. ENZI>over just six months despite the

6929
06:12:59 --> 06:13:01
<v MR. ENZI>fact that it drew over 65,000

6930
06:13:01 --> 06:13:03
<v MR. ENZI>comments in two-month period

6931
06:13:03 --> 06:13:05
<v MR. ENZI>after it was first proposed.

6932
06:13:05 --> 06:13:07
<v MR. ENZI>Had the board held the comment

6933
06:13:07 --> 06:13:08
<v MR. ENZI>period longer to allow more

6934
06:13:08 --> 06:13:10
<v MR. ENZI>input from the regulated

6935
06:13:10 --> 06:13:12
<v MR. ENZI>community which was clearly

6936
06:13:12 --> 06:13:13
<v MR. ENZI>quite engaged on the proposal,

6937
06:13:13 --> 06:13:14
<v MR. ENZI>it would have certainly have

6938
06:13:14 --> 06:13:16
<v MR. ENZI>received even more comments.

6939
06:13:16 --> 06:13:17
<v MR. ENZI>Yet this relatively small agency

6940
06:13:17 --> 06:13:22
<v MR. ENZI>report that had it read through

6941
06:13:22 --> 06:13:26
<v MR. ENZI>all 65,957 comments in just

6942
06:13:26 --> 06:13:28
<v MR. ENZI>seven weeks.

6943
06:13:28 --> 06:13:31
<v MR. ENZI>Then they released a modified

6944
06:13:31 --> 06:13:33
<v MR. ENZI>rule and it was finalized.

6945
06:13:33 --> 06:13:36
<v MR. ENZI>The rule was finalized days

6946
06:13:36 --> 06:13:39
<v MR. ENZI>before the board lost its quorum

6947
06:13:39 --> 06:13:40
<v MR. ENZI>with the expiration of member

6948
06:13:40 --> 06:13:40
<v MR. ENZI>becker's recess appointment

6949
06:13:40 --> 06:13:42
<v MR. ENZI>term.

6950
06:13:42 --> 06:13:43
<v MR. ENZI>under any circumstances a

6951
06:13:43 --> 06:13:45
<v MR. ENZI>rule-making this hasty looks

6952
06:13:45 --> 06:13:47
<v MR. ENZI>suspicious n. This case there's

6953
06:13:47 --> 06:13:49
<v MR. ENZI>simply no justification for the

6954
06:13:49 --> 06:13:52
<v MR. ENZI>rush.

6955
06:13:52 --> 06:13:54
<v MR. ENZI>Today's secret blot elections --

6956
06:13:54 --> 06:13:56
<v MR. ENZI>ballot elections occur in a

6957
06:13:56 --> 06:13:59
<v MR. ENZI>medium time frame of 38 days.

6958
06:13:59 --> 06:13:59
<v MR. ENZI>Unions win more than 71% of the

6959
06:13:59 --> 06:14:01
<v MR. ENZI>elections.

6960
06:14:01 --> 06:14:01
<v MR. ENZI>Their highest win rate on

6961
06:14:01 --> 06:14:03
<v MR. ENZI>record.

6962
06:14:03 --> 06:14:05
<v MR. ENZI>the system does not disadvantage

6963
06:14:05 --> 06:14:07
<v MR. ENZI>labor unions at all, but it does

6964
06:14:07 --> 06:14:08
<v MR. ENZI>ensure that there's fairness for

6965
06:14:08 --> 06:14:10
<v MR. ENZI>the employees, whose right it is

6966
06:14:10 --> 06:14:14
<v MR. ENZI>to make that decision of whether

6967
06:14:14 --> 06:14:16
<v MR. ENZI>or not to form a union, to pay

6968
06:14:16 --> 06:14:19
<v MR. ENZI>the union dues, and to have some

6969
06:14:19 --> 06:14:21
<v MR. ENZI>of that sometimes go in

6970
06:14:21 --> 06:14:23
<v MR. ENZI>political campaigns.

6971
06:14:23 --> 06:14:24
<v MR. ENZI>there's supposed to be a poster

6972
06:14:24 --> 06:14:25
<v MR. ENZI>that gives them the right not to

6973
06:14:25 --> 06:14:27
<v MR. ENZI>have their money going to

6974
06:14:27 --> 06:14:28
<v MR. ENZI>political campaigns, but this

6975
06:14:28 --> 06:14:30
<v MR. ENZI>administration has taken that

6976
06:14:30 --> 06:14:31
<v MR. ENZI>off of the poster so they're no

6977
06:14:31 --> 06:14:33
<v MR. ENZI>longer informed of that right.

6978
06:14:33 --> 06:14:34
<v MR. ENZI>It does ensure fairness for

6979
06:14:34 --> 06:14:35
<v MR. ENZI>employees whose right it is to

6980
06:14:35 --> 06:14:38
<v MR. ENZI>make the decision of whether or

6981
06:14:38 --> 06:14:40
<v MR. ENZI>not to form a union and have the

6982
06:14:40 --> 06:14:41
<v MR. ENZI>full opportunity to hear from

6983
06:14:41 --> 06:14:43
<v MR. ENZI>both sides about the

6984
06:14:43 --> 06:14:45
<v MR. ENZI>ramifications of that decision.

6985
06:14:45 --> 06:14:47
<v MR. ENZI>have the time to get full

6986
06:14:47 --> 06:14:48
<v MR. ENZI>disclosure.

6987
06:14:48 --> 06:14:50
<v MR. ENZI>The principle of law has been

6988
06:14:50 --> 06:14:52
<v MR. ENZI>upheld for nearly seven decades.

6989
06:14:52 --> 06:14:54
<v MR. ENZI>It was senator john f. Kennedy

6990
06:14:54 --> 06:14:56
<v MR. ENZI>who argued during the debate

6991
06:14:56 --> 06:14:57
<v MR. ENZI>oefrp 1959 amendments to the law

6992
06:14:57 --> 06:14:59
<v MR. ENZI>that -- quote -- &quot;there should

6993
06:14:59 --> 06:15:00
<v MR. ENZI>be at least a 30-day interval

6994
06:15:00 --> 06:15:03
<v MR. ENZI>between the request for an

6995
06:15:03 --> 06:15:04
<v MR. ENZI>election and the holding of an

6996
06:15:04 --> 06:15:09
<v MR. ENZI>election in which both parties

6997
06:15:09 --> 06:15:10
<v MR. ENZI>can present their viewpoints.&quot;

6998
06:15:10 --> 06:15:11
<v MR. ENZI>frankly, whenever I hear a

6999
06:15:11 --> 06:15:13
<v MR. ENZI>government decision that aims to

7000
06:15:13 --> 06:15:15
<v MR. ENZI>limit information available to

7001
06:15:15 --> 06:15:18
<v MR. ENZI>citizens and depress free

7002
06:15:18 --> 06:15:19
<v MR. ENZI>speech, I'm very concerned.

7003
06:15:19 --> 06:15:21
<v MR. ENZI>It was the sort of agenda that

7004
06:15:21 --> 06:15:22
<v MR. ENZI>was behind the card check

7005
06:15:22 --> 06:15:23
<v MR. ENZI>legislation which was defeated

7006
06:15:23 --> 06:15:25
<v MR. ENZI>in the senate.

7007
06:15:25 --> 06:15:26
<v MR. ENZI>let me repeat that again.

7008
06:15:26 --> 06:15:29
<v MR. ENZI>It was that sort of agenda that

7009
06:15:29 --> 06:15:31
<v MR. ENZI>was behind the card check

7010
06:15:31 --> 06:15:32
<v MR. ENZI>legislation that was defeated in

7011
06:15:32 --> 06:15:33
<v MR. ENZI>the senate.

7012
06:15:33 --> 06:15:35
<v MR. ENZI>I'm afraid that this rule has

7013
06:15:35 --> 06:15:36
<v MR. ENZI>been hatched in the same

7014
06:15:36 --> 06:15:39
<v MR. ENZI>laboratory, and I hope that it

7015
06:15:39 --> 06:15:42
<v MR. ENZI>will meet the same fate.

7016
06:15:42 --> 06:15:43
<v MR. ENZI>The ambush elections rules

7017
06:15:43 --> 06:15:45
<v MR. ENZI>eliminates the 25-day waiting

7018
06:15:45 --> 06:15:47
<v MR. ENZI>period to conduct elections in

7019
06:15:47 --> 06:15:49
<v MR. ENZI>cases where a party has filed a

7020
06:15:49 --> 06:15:50
<v MR. ENZI>preelection request for review.

7021
06:15:50 --> 06:15:52
<v MR. ENZI>It effectively eliminates the

7022
06:15:52 --> 06:15:54
<v MR. ENZI>opportunity for parties to voice

7023
06:15:54 --> 06:15:55
<v MR. ENZI>objections and settle issues

7024
06:15:55 --> 06:15:57
<v MR. ENZI>before the elections.

7025
06:15:57 --> 06:15:58
<v MR. ENZI>And it limits the ability to

7026
06:15:58 --> 06:16:01
<v MR. ENZI>address them after the elections

7027
06:16:01 --> 06:16:03
<v MR. ENZI>as well.

7028
06:16:03 --> 06:16:05
<v MR. ENZI>What are we trying to hide?

7029
06:16:05 --> 06:16:07
<v MR. ENZI>The effect of these changes will

7030
06:16:07 --> 06:16:09
<v MR. ENZI>be union seniority if I occasion

7031
06:16:09 --> 06:16:09
<v MR. ENZI>elections held in as few as ten

7032
06:16:09 --> 06:16:11
<v MR. ENZI>days.

7033
06:16:11 --> 06:16:12
<v MR. ENZI>Union organizers will hand the

7034
06:16:12 --> 06:16:13
<v MR. ENZI>selected members of the

7035
06:16:13 --> 06:16:15
<v MR. ENZI>bargaining unit and any review

7036
06:16:15 --> 06:16:16
<v MR. ENZI>of the appropriateness of the

7037
06:16:16 --> 06:16:19
<v MR. ENZI>unit makeup or status of

7038
06:16:19 --> 06:16:19
<v MR. ENZI>employees who May qualify as

7039
06:16:19 --> 06:16:21
<v MR. ENZI>survivors.

7040
06:16:21 --> 06:16:24
<v MR. ENZI>That will be postponed until

7041
06:16:24 --> 06:16:25
<v MR. ENZI>after the election.

7042
06:16:25 --> 06:16:25
<v MR. ENZI>Always has been before the

7043
06:16:26 --> 06:16:26
<v MR. ENZI>election.

7044
06:16:26 --> 06:16:28
<v MR. ENZI>Employees will be voting on

7045
06:16:28 --> 06:16:30
<v MR. ENZI>whether to form a union without

7046
06:16:30 --> 06:16:33
<v MR. ENZI>any idea of who will actually be

7047
06:16:33 --> 06:16:34
<v MR. ENZI>in the bargaining unit.

7048
06:16:34 --> 06:16:37
<v MR. ENZI>Employers will be caught off

7049
06:16:37 --> 06:16:38
<v MR. ENZI>guard and potentially flying

7050
06:16:38 --> 06:16:40
<v MR. ENZI>blind with regard to their

7051
06:16:40 --> 06:16:40
<v MR. ENZI>rights under the law,

7052
06:16:40 --> 06:16:43
<v MR. ENZI>particularly small businesses.

7053
06:16:43 --> 06:16:44
<v MR. ENZI>Union organizers spend months if

7054
06:16:44 --> 06:16:47
<v MR. ENZI>not years organizing and

7055
06:16:47 --> 06:16:48
<v MR. ENZI>spreading their message to their

7056
06:16:48 --> 06:16:49
<v MR. ENZI>employees, unbeknownst to their

7057
06:16:49 --> 06:16:50
<v MR. ENZI>employer.

7058
06:16:50 --> 06:16:52
<v MR. ENZI>So when a union files a

7059
06:16:52 --> 06:16:53
<v MR. ENZI>representation petition,

7060
06:16:53 --> 06:16:54
<v MR. ENZI>employers are already at a

7061
06:16:54 --> 06:16:55
<v MR. ENZI>significant disadvantage in

7062
06:16:55 --> 06:16:57
<v MR. ENZI>educating employees about their

7063
06:16:57 --> 06:16:59
<v MR. ENZI>views on unionization.

7064
06:16:59 --> 06:17:01
<v MR. ENZI>Employers also use this time to

7065
06:17:01 --> 06:17:02
<v MR. ENZI>consult with their attorneys to

7066
06:17:02 --> 06:17:04
<v MR. ENZI>ensure their actions are

7067
06:17:04 --> 06:17:05
<v MR. ENZI>permissible under the law.

7068
06:17:05 --> 06:17:07
<v MR. ENZI>Shortening the time period will

7069
06:17:07 --> 06:17:09
<v MR. ENZI>increase the likelihood that

7070
06:17:09 --> 06:17:11
<v MR. ENZI>employers will act hastily,

7071
06:17:11 --> 06:17:14
<v MR. ENZI>opening themselves up to unfair

7072
06:17:14 --> 06:17:17
<v MR. ENZI>labor practices, charges that

7073
06:17:17 --> 06:17:18
<v MR. ENZI>have very severe consequences.

7074
06:17:18 --> 06:17:18
<v MR. ENZI>I'm particularly concerned about

7075
06:17:18 --> 06:17:21
<v MR. ENZI>the small businesses that will

7076
06:17:21 --> 06:17:22
<v MR. ENZI>be ambushed under this rule.

7077
06:17:22 --> 06:17:24
<v MR. ENZI>Instead of focusing on growing

7078
06:17:24 --> 06:17:25
<v MR. ENZI>and creating more jobs, they

7079
06:17:25 --> 06:17:27
<v MR. ENZI>will be swamped with legal

7080
06:17:27 --> 06:17:29
<v MR. ENZI>issues, with bargaining

7081
06:17:29 --> 06:17:31
<v MR. ENZI>obligations, a less flexible

7082
06:17:31 --> 06:17:32
<v MR. ENZI>work force and increased costs

7083
06:17:32 --> 06:17:33
<v MR. ENZI>across the board.

7084
06:17:33 --> 06:17:34
<v MR. ENZI>Most small businesses likely

7085
06:17:34 --> 06:17:37
<v MR. ENZI>have no idea about the changes

7086
06:17:37 --> 06:17:39
<v MR. ENZI>being made by the national labor

7087
06:17:39 --> 06:17:42
<v MR. ENZI>relations board because the rule

7088
06:17:42 --> 06:17:44
<v MR. ENZI>was rushed so hastily.

7089
06:17:44 --> 06:17:45
<v MR. ENZI>Instead of directing the

7090
06:17:45 --> 06:17:47
<v MR. ENZI>national labor relations board

7091
06:17:47 --> 06:17:50
<v MR. ENZI>to focus on enforcing current

7092
06:17:50 --> 06:17:53
<v MR. ENZI>law rather than ambushing small

7093
06:17:53 --> 06:17:54
<v MR. ENZI>business job creators and their

7094
06:17:54 --> 06:17:57
<v MR. ENZI>employees, President Obama has

7095
06:17:57 --> 06:17:58
<v MR. ENZI>stacked the board with

7096
06:17:58 --> 06:18:00
<v MR. ENZI>unconstitutional recess

7097
06:18:00 --> 06:18:03
<v MR. ENZI>appointees and requested a

7098
06:18:03 --> 06:18:04
<v MR. ENZI>$15 million increase in their

7099
06:18:04 --> 06:18:05
<v MR. ENZI>budget.

7100
06:18:05 --> 06:18:06
<v MR. ENZI>He simply doesn't understand.

7101
06:18:06 --> 06:18:07
<v MR. ENZI>He doesn't get it.

7102
06:18:07 --> 06:18:09
<v MR. ENZI>By passing this resolution

7103
06:18:09 --> 06:18:11
<v MR. ENZI>through both the house and

7104
06:18:11 --> 06:18:14
<v MR. ENZI>senate, we will strike a victory

7105
06:18:14 --> 06:18:16
<v MR. ENZI>for those on the side of job

7106
06:18:16 --> 06:18:16
<v MR. ENZI>creation and fairness to

7107
06:18:16 --> 06:18:18
<v MR. ENZI>employees.

7108
06:18:18 --> 06:18:20
<v MR. ENZI>It will also send a very

7109
06:18:20 --> 06:18:23
<v MR. ENZI>important message to a runaway

7110
06:18:23 --> 06:18:25
<v MR. ENZI>agency under this

7111
06:18:25 --> 06:18:26
<v MR. ENZI>administration, the national

7112
06:18:26 --> 06:18:27
<v MR. ENZI>labor relations board has been

7113
06:18:27 --> 06:18:28
<v MR. ENZI>more controversial than most

7114
06:18:28 --> 06:18:30
<v MR. ENZI>observers can ever remember.

7115
06:18:30 --> 06:18:32
<v MR. ENZI>they have flouted the intentions

7116
06:18:32 --> 06:18:34
<v MR. ENZI>of congress repeatedly, and the

7117
06:18:34 --> 06:18:39
<v MR. ENZI>President Has defined a recess

7118
06:18:39 --> 06:18:42
<v MR. ENZI>appointment in order to keep it

7119
06:18:42 --> 06:18:43
<v MR. ENZI>going.

7120
06:18:43 --> 06:18:45
<v MR. ENZI>They have redefined it.

7121
06:18:45 --> 06:18:45
<v MR. ENZI>There is no law that allowed

7122
06:18:45 --> 06:18:46
<v MR. ENZI>that.

7123
06:18:46 --> 06:18:48
<v MR. ENZI>There is no change that has been

7124
06:18:48 --> 06:18:49
<v MR. ENZI>made that would allow a

7125
06:18:49 --> 06:18:50
<v MR. ENZI>President To do something

7126
06:18:50 --> 06:18:51
<v MR. ENZI>different than has ever been

7127
06:18:51 --> 06:18:52
<v MR. ENZI>done before.

7128
06:18:52 --> 06:18:54
<v MR. ENZI>But he did it.

7129
06:18:54 --> 06:18:55
<v MR. ENZI>He redefined the recess

7130
06:18:55 --> 06:18:56
<v MR. ENZI>appointment in order to keep the

7131
06:18:56 --> 06:18:58
<v MR. ENZI>board going.

7132
06:18:58 --> 06:19:00
<v MR. ENZI>A few weeks ago, national labor

7133
06:19:00 --> 06:19:01
<v MR. ENZI>relations board Chairman Pierce

7134
06:19:01 --> 06:19:03
<v MR. ENZI>announced that he intends to

7135
06:19:03 --> 06:19:03
<v MR. ENZI>push through even more

7136
06:19:03 --> 06:19:05
<v MR. ENZI>controversial changes to the

7137
06:19:05 --> 06:19:06
<v MR. ENZI>elections rule before the end of

7138
06:19:06 --> 06:19:08
<v MR. ENZI>the year.

7139
06:19:08 --> 06:19:08
<v MR. ENZI>That's as long as his term would

7140
06:19:08 --> 06:19:10
<v MR. ENZI>last.

7141
06:19:10 --> 06:19:11
<v MR. ENZI>he's planning to require a

7142
06:19:11 --> 06:19:13
<v MR. ENZI>mandatory hearing seven days

7143
06:19:13 --> 06:19:15
<v MR. ENZI>after a petition is filed.

7144
06:19:15 --> 06:19:17
<v MR. ENZI>Employers would be forced to

7145
06:19:17 --> 06:19:20
<v MR. ENZI>file a position statement on

7146
06:19:20 --> 06:19:22
<v MR. ENZI>important legal questions at the

7147
06:19:22 --> 06:19:24
<v MR. ENZI>hearing or lose the right to

7148
06:19:24 --> 06:19:27
<v MR. ENZI>subsequently argue those issues.

7149
06:19:27 --> 06:19:28
<v MR. ENZI>He plans to require employers to

7150
06:19:28 --> 06:19:30
<v MR. ENZI>provide personal employee

7151
06:19:30 --> 06:19:33
<v MR. ENZI>information to union organizers

7152
06:19:33 --> 06:19:34
<v MR. ENZI>such as email addresses within

7153
06:19:34 --> 06:19:35
<v MR. ENZI>two days.

7154
06:19:35 --> 06:19:38
<v MR. ENZI>Do you think the employees want

7155
06:19:38 --> 06:19:39
<v MR. ENZI>to be harassed with emails?

7156
06:19:39 --> 06:19:40
<v MR. ENZI>I doubt it.

7157
06:19:40 --> 06:19:43
<v MR. ENZI>Mr. President, these changes

7158
06:19:43 --> 06:19:44
<v MR. ENZI>would completely cripple any

7159
06:19:44 --> 06:19:48
<v MR. ENZI>employer's ability to have a

7160
06:19:48 --> 06:19:50
<v MR. ENZI>voice in the decisionmaking

7161
06:19:50 --> 06:19:50
<v MR. ENZI>process, let alone small

7162
06:19:50 --> 06:19:51
<v MR. ENZI>employers.

7163
06:19:51 --> 06:19:52
<v MR. ENZI>Enacting resolution of the

7164
06:19:52 --> 06:19:54
<v MR. ENZI>disapproval of the ambush

7165
06:19:54 --> 06:19:55
<v MR. ENZI>elections rule would prevent

7166
06:19:55 --> 06:19:58
<v MR. ENZI>Chairman Pierce from

7167
06:19:58 --> 06:19:59
<v MR. ENZI>promulgating these

7168
06:19:59 --> 06:19:59
<v MR. ENZI>destructive -- constructive

7169
06:19:59 --> 06:20:00
<v MR. ENZI>changes.

7170
06:20:00 --> 06:20:01
<v MR. ENZI>They will not roll back any

7171
06:20:01 --> 06:20:03
<v MR. ENZI>rights or privileges.

7172
06:20:03 --> 06:20:05
<v MR. ENZI>It would simply return these

7173
06:20:05 --> 06:20:07
<v MR. ENZI>workplace rules to current law.

7174
06:20:07 --> 06:20:08
<v MR. ENZI>Current law, not current rule,

7175
06:20:08 --> 06:20:12
<v MR. ENZI>current law.

7176
06:20:12 --> 06:20:14
<v MR. ENZI>just returns it to the workplace

7177
06:20:14 --> 06:20:15
<v MR. ENZI>rules that we have for current

7178
06:20:15 --> 06:20:16
<v MR. ENZI>law.

7179
06:20:16 --> 06:20:18
<v MR. ENZI>And I will remind my colleagues

7180
06:20:18 --> 06:20:20
<v MR. ENZI>that current law is a fair

7181
06:20:20 --> 06:20:23
<v MR. ENZI>system under which employees

7182
06:20:23 --> 06:20:25
<v MR. ENZI>retain the right to decide by

7183
06:20:25 --> 06:20:26
<v MR. ENZI>secret ballot election whether

7184
06:20:26 --> 06:20:28
<v MR. ENZI>to form a union.

7185
06:20:28 --> 06:20:31
<v MR. ENZI>Elections occur in a medium of

7186
06:20:31 --> 06:20:32
<v MR. ENZI>38 days, and the unions win 71%

7187
06:20:32 --> 06:20:33
<v MR. ENZI>of the elections.

7188
06:20:33 --> 06:20:35
<v MR. ENZI>I do have letters of support

7189
06:20:35 --> 06:20:38
<v MR. ENZI>from a number of groups that I'd

7190
06:20:38 --> 06:20:38
<v MR. ENZI>like to place in the record.

7191
06:20:40 --> 06:20:40
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

7192
06:20:40 --> 06:20:41
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

7193
06:20:42 --> 06:20:43
<v MR. ENZI>and I look forward to

7194
06:20:43 --> 06:20:44
<v MR. ENZI>the opportunity to debate this

7195
06:20:44 --> 06:20:45
<v MR. ENZI>resolution on the floor, and I

7196
06:20:45 --> 06:20:47
<v MR. ENZI>thank the senators that have

7197
06:20:47 --> 06:20:47
<v MR. ENZI>joined me as original

7198
06:20:47 --> 06:20:48
<v MR. ENZI>cosponsors.

7199
06:20:48 --> 06:20:49
<v MR. ENZI>I yield the floor and suggest

7200
06:20:49 --> 06:20:50
<v MR. ENZI>the absence of a quorum.

7201
06:20:50 --> 06:20:53
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the clerk

7202
06:20:53 --> 06:20:54
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>will call the roll.

7203
06:21:56 --> 06:21:58
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

7204
06:21:58 --> 06:21:59
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senator from colorado.

7205
06:21:59 --> 06:22:01
<v MR. BENNET>Mr. President, I ask

7206
06:22:01 --> 06:22:02
<v MR. BENNET>the quorum call be vitiated.

7207
06:22:02 --> 06:22:02
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

7208
06:22:02 --> 06:22:03
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

7209
06:22:03 --> 06:22:04
<v MR. BENNET>Mr. President, I am

7210
06:22:04 --> 06:22:06
<v MR. BENNET>here on the floor today to talk

7211
06:22:06 --> 06:22:08
<v MR. BENNET>a little bit about our economy

7212
06:22:08 --> 06:22:12
<v MR. BENNET>and something that I think is

7213
06:22:12 --> 06:22:13
<v MR. BENNET>very important that has been

7214
06:22:13 --> 06:22:15
<v MR. BENNET>left unaddressed in this payroll

7215
06:22:15 --> 06:22:19
<v MR. BENNET>tax compromise that I think is a

7216
06:22:19 --> 06:22:21
<v MR. BENNET>real tragedy for our country and

7217
06:22:21 --> 06:22:22
<v MR. BENNET>for my state, the state of

7218
06:22:22 --> 06:22:23
<v MR. BENNET>colorado, most importantly for

7219
06:22:23 --> 06:22:25
<v MR. BENNET>people that are suffering

7220
06:22:25 --> 06:22:26
<v MR. BENNET>through this incredibly

7221
06:22:26 --> 06:22:29
<v MR. BENNET>difficult economy.

7222
06:22:29 --> 06:22:33
<v MR. BENNET>You know, it is not well

7223
06:22:33 --> 06:22:34
<v MR. BENNET>understood by people, I think

7224
06:22:34 --> 06:22:36
<v MR. BENNET>maybe even in this chamber, that

7225
06:22:36 --> 06:22:38
<v MR. BENNET>our country's G.D.P., our gross

7226
06:22:38 --> 06:22:39
<v MR. BENNET>domestic product, the economic

7227
06:22:39 --> 06:22:42
<v MR. BENNET>output of our country is

7228
06:22:42 --> 06:22:44
<v MR. BENNET>actually higher today than it

7229
06:22:44 --> 06:22:44
<v MR. BENNET>was before we went into this

7230
06:22:44 --> 06:22:46
<v MR. BENNET>recession.

7231
06:22:46 --> 06:22:48
<v MR. BENNET>You see it rising all the way in

7232
06:22:48 --> 06:22:50
<v MR. BENNET>the 1990's in 2000 and then we

7233
06:22:50 --> 06:22:51
<v MR. BENNET>had the worst recession since

7234
06:22:51 --> 06:22:53
<v MR. BENNET>the great depression, and now

7235
06:22:53 --> 06:22:54
<v MR. BENNET>we're seeing economic output

7236
06:22:54 --> 06:22:55
<v MR. BENNET>that's actually at a level

7237
06:22:55 --> 06:22:58
<v MR. BENNET>that's higher than it was before

7238
06:22:58 --> 06:23:00
<v MR. BENNET>we went into the recession.

7239
06:23:00 --> 06:23:03
<v MR. BENNET>Our productivity is higher today

7240
06:23:03 --> 06:23:06
<v MR. BENNET>than it has been at any time in

7241
06:23:06 --> 06:23:08
<v MR. BENNET>the history of the united states

7242
06:23:08 --> 06:23:12
<v MR. BENNET>of america.

7243
06:23:12 --> 06:23:13
<v MR. BENNET>It's become fashionable to talk

7244
06:23:13 --> 06:23:14
<v MR. BENNET>about what's happened or not

7245
06:23:14 --> 06:23:15
<v MR. BENNET>happened since the founding of

7246
06:23:15 --> 06:23:16
<v MR. BENNET>our country.

7247
06:23:16 --> 06:23:18
<v MR. BENNET>Since the founding of our

7248
06:23:18 --> 06:23:20
<v MR. BENNET>country, our economy has never

7249
06:23:20 --> 06:23:21
<v MR. BENNET>been more productive than it is

7250
06:23:21 --> 06:23:22
<v MR. BENNET>today.

7251
06:23:22 --> 06:23:24
<v MR. BENNET>And there are several reasons

7252
06:23:24 --> 06:23:27
<v MR. BENNET>for that.

7253
06:23:27 --> 06:23:31
<v MR. BENNET>Competition from abroad that has

7254
06:23:31 --> 06:23:32
<v MR. BENNET>become a daily occurrence,

7255
06:23:32 --> 06:23:35
<v MR. BENNET>something that we have to fight

7256
06:23:35 --> 06:23:37
<v MR. BENNET>about every day to stay ahead

7257
06:23:37 --> 06:23:38
<v MR. BENNET>of.

7258
06:23:38 --> 06:23:39
<v MR. BENNET>That's driven productivity.

7259
06:23:39 --> 06:23:40
<v MR. BENNET>That's a good thing.

7260
06:23:40 --> 06:23:41
<v MR. BENNET>Technology has driven

7261
06:23:41 --> 06:23:42
<v MR. BENNET>productivity.

7262
06:23:42 --> 06:23:43
<v MR. BENNET>That's a good thing.

7263
06:23:43 --> 06:23:46
<v MR. BENNET>And the recession itself,

7264
06:23:46 --> 06:23:47
<v MR. BENNET>Mr. President, you can see drove

7265
06:23:47 --> 06:23:49
<v MR. BENNET>productivity straight up.

7266
06:23:49 --> 06:23:51
<v MR. BENNET>As our business men and women in

7267
06:23:51 --> 06:23:53
<v MR. BENNET>this country did what they had

7268
06:23:53 --> 06:23:54
<v MR. BENNET>to do to get through this

7269
06:23:54 --> 06:23:55
<v MR. BENNET>incredibly tough economic time

7270
06:23:55 --> 06:23:57
<v MR. BENNET>to keep their businesses alive,

7271
06:23:57 --> 06:23:59
<v MR. BENNET>to keep their doors open, to

7272
06:23:59 --> 06:24:02
<v MR. BENNET>keep a promise to the next

7273
06:24:02 --> 06:24:04
<v MR. BENNET>generation of americans,

7274
06:24:04 --> 06:24:06
<v MR. BENNET>productivity went ever skyward.

7275
06:24:06 --> 06:24:06
<v MR. BENNET>That's a good thing.

7276
06:24:06 --> 06:24:08
<v MR. BENNET>That's progress.

7277
06:24:08 --> 06:24:10
<v MR. BENNET>And we're only going to become

7278
06:24:10 --> 06:24:11
<v MR. BENNET>more productive over time as we

7279
06:24:11 --> 06:24:12
<v MR. BENNET>face competitive threats from

7280
06:24:12 --> 06:24:14
<v MR. BENNET>around the world.

7281
06:24:14 --> 06:24:16
<v MR. BENNET>But, Mr. President, you can see

7282
06:24:16 --> 06:24:17
<v MR. BENNET>what else has happened over this

7283
06:24:17 --> 06:24:19
<v MR. BENNET>period of time.

7284
06:24:19 --> 06:24:21
<v MR. BENNET>Median family income has fallen

7285
06:24:21 --> 06:24:25
<v MR. BENNET>over the last decade for the

7286
06:24:25 --> 06:24:26
<v MR. BENNET>first time in our country's

7287
06:24:26 --> 06:24:28
<v MR. BENNET>history.

7288
06:24:28 --> 06:24:29
<v MR. BENNET>The middle class is earning less

7289
06:24:29 --> 06:24:34
<v MR. BENNET>today in real dollars than they

7290
06:24:34 --> 06:24:36
<v MR. BENNET>were in the early 1990's, and as

7291
06:24:36 --> 06:24:40
<v MR. BENNET>the President Knows, we are

7292
06:24:40 --> 06:24:41
<v MR. BENNET>producing this economic output

7293
06:24:41 --> 06:24:43
<v MR. BENNET>with 23 million or 24 million

7294
06:24:43 --> 06:24:45
<v MR. BENNET>people that today are unemployed

7295
06:24:45 --> 06:24:45
<v MR. BENNET>or underemployed in this

7296
06:24:45 --> 06:24:47
<v MR. BENNET>economy.

7297
06:24:47 --> 06:24:49
<v MR. BENNET>There are not jobs for these

7298
06:24:49 --> 06:24:52
<v MR. BENNET>americans in this economy even

7299
06:24:52 --> 06:24:55
<v MR. BENNET>though our output is as high as

7300
06:24:55 --> 06:24:55
<v MR. BENNET>it was before we went into this

7301
06:24:55 --> 06:24:57
<v MR. BENNET>recession.

7302
06:24:57 --> 06:24:59
<v MR. BENNET>now, there are a lot of people

7303
06:24:59 --> 06:25:00
<v MR. BENNET>smarter than I am that could

7304
06:25:00 --> 06:25:01
<v MR. BENNET>figure out the answers to this

7305
06:25:01 --> 06:25:03
<v MR. BENNET>thing, but there are at least

7306
06:25:03 --> 06:25:04
<v MR. BENNET>two big ones that we have to

7307
06:25:04 --> 06:25:08
<v MR. BENNET>keep in mind.

7308
06:25:08 --> 06:25:11
<v MR. BENNET>The first one is education.

7309
06:25:11 --> 06:25:12
<v MR. BENNET>Because the worse the

7310
06:25:12 --> 06:25:13
<v MR. BENNET>unemployment rate ever got for

7311
06:25:13 --> 06:25:18
<v MR. BENNET>people with a college degree

7312
06:25:18 --> 06:25:18
<v MR. BENNET>during this recession was 4.5%.

7313
06:25:18 --> 06:25:20
<v MR. BENNET>4.5%.

7314
06:25:20 --> 06:25:23
<v MR. BENNET>That's the worst it got for

7315
06:25:23 --> 06:25:25
<v MR. BENNET>people that had a college degree

7316
06:25:25 --> 06:25:26
<v MR. BENNET>who could compete in the 21st

7317
06:25:26 --> 06:25:29
<v MR. BENNET>century even in the worst

7318
06:25:29 --> 06:25:29
<v MR. BENNET>recession since the great

7319
06:25:29 --> 06:25:30
<v MR. BENNET>depression.

7320
06:25:30 --> 06:25:33
<v MR. BENNET>But as I have said on the floor

7321
06:25:33 --> 06:25:36
<v MR. BENNET>here before, Mr. President, this

7322
06:25:36 --> 06:25:38
<v MR. BENNET>floor, this chamber that has 100

7323
06:25:38 --> 06:25:39
<v MR. BENNET>seats, 100 desks, if we were

7324
06:25:39 --> 06:25:41
<v MR. BENNET>poor children living in the

7325
06:25:41 --> 06:25:45
<v MR. BENNET>united states of america today,

7326
06:25:45 --> 06:25:47
<v MR. BENNET>only nine, nine of these 100

7327
06:25:47 --> 06:25:50
<v MR. BENNET>seats would represent college

7328
06:25:50 --> 06:25:51
<v MR. BENNET>graduates, because 91 of 100

7329
06:25:51 --> 06:25:52
<v MR. BENNET>poor children in the united

7330
06:25:52 --> 06:25:55
<v MR. BENNET>states in the 21st century

7331
06:25:55 --> 06:25:56
<v MR. BENNET>cannot get access to a college

7332
06:25:56 --> 06:25:58
<v MR. BENNET>degree.

7333
06:25:58 --> 06:25:59
<v MR. BENNET>so that's job number one to keep

7334
06:25:59 --> 06:26:01
<v MR. BENNET>a promise to the next generation

7335
06:26:01 --> 06:26:04
<v MR. BENNET>of americans, but job number two

7336
06:26:04 --> 06:26:06
<v MR. BENNET>I think needs to be driving

7337
06:26:06 --> 06:26:08
<v MR. BENNET>innovation and job growth in

7338
06:26:08 --> 06:26:10
<v MR. BENNET>this economy, which is what has

7339
06:26:10 --> 06:26:11
<v MR. BENNET>brought me to the floor here

7340
06:26:11 --> 06:26:14
<v MR. BENNET>today because, Mr. President, we

7341
06:26:14 --> 06:26:17
<v MR. BENNET>are failing in this package,

7342
06:26:17 --> 06:26:20
<v MR. BENNET>among other things, to extend

7343
06:26:20 --> 06:26:21
<v MR. BENNET>the wind production tax credit

7344
06:26:21 --> 06:26:23
<v MR. BENNET>which cuts right to the core of

7345
06:26:23 --> 06:26:25
<v MR. BENNET>whether and how we want to

7346
06:26:25 --> 06:26:27
<v MR. BENNET>compete in the 21st century in

7347
06:26:27 --> 06:26:29
<v MR. BENNET>this global economy, and for

7348
06:26:29 --> 06:26:31
<v MR. BENNET>people here or elsewhere that

7349
06:26:31 --> 06:26:33
<v MR. BENNET>think these jobs aren't really

7350
06:26:33 --> 06:26:34
<v MR. BENNET>in the wind industry, I brought

7351
06:26:34 --> 06:26:36
<v MR. BENNET>some pictures.

7352
06:26:36 --> 06:26:38
<v MR. BENNET>I brought some pictures of a

7353
06:26:38 --> 06:26:42
<v MR. BENNET>plant, a manufacturing plant

7354
06:26:42 --> 06:26:42
<v MR. BENNET>made in america, made in

7355
06:26:42 --> 06:26:45
<v MR. BENNET>america.

7356
06:26:45 --> 06:26:47
<v MR. BENNET>In this case, in brighton,

7357
06:26:47 --> 06:26:50
<v MR. BENNET>colorado, a manufacturing plant

7358
06:26:50 --> 06:26:52
<v MR. BENNET>of the towers from which wind

7359
06:26:52 --> 06:26:54
<v MR. BENNET>turbines are going to be hung,

7360
06:26:54 --> 06:26:55
<v MR. BENNET>driving electricity and jobs in

7361
06:26:55 --> 06:26:57
<v MR. BENNET>the united states.

7362
06:26:57 --> 06:26:59
<v MR. BENNET>So we're not talking about some

7363
06:26:59 --> 06:27:01
<v MR. BENNET>fly-by-night experimental

7364
06:27:01 --> 06:27:03
<v MR. BENNET>industry here.

7365
06:27:03 --> 06:27:05
<v MR. BENNET>This credit has triggered

7366
06:27:05 --> 06:27:08
<v MR. BENNET>enormous economic growth in

7367
06:27:08 --> 06:27:10
<v MR. BENNET>colorado and across the country.

7368
06:27:10 --> 06:27:12
<v MR. BENNET>As congressman steve king, a

7369
06:27:12 --> 06:27:15
<v MR. BENNET>republican from iowa, wrote

7370
06:27:15 --> 06:27:16
<v MR. BENNET>today in an op-ed he published,

7371
06:27:16 --> 06:27:22
<v MR. BENNET>&quot;the production tax credit has

7372
06:27:22 --> 06:27:23
<v MR. BENNET>driven as much as $20 billion in

7373
06:27:23 --> 06:27:26
<v MR. BENNET>private investing.&quot;

7374
06:27:26 --> 06:27:29
<v MR. BENNET>this isn't some bolshevik trick,

7375
06:27:29 --> 06:27:30
<v MR. BENNET>some socialist trick.

7376
06:27:30 --> 06:27:31
<v MR. BENNET>$20 billion in private

7377
06:27:31 --> 06:27:33
<v MR. BENNET>investment, in real american

7378
06:27:33 --> 06:27:34
<v MR. BENNET>manufacturing jobs.

7379
06:27:34 --> 06:27:37
<v MR. BENNET>Wind power accounts for more

7380
06:27:37 --> 06:27:39
<v MR. BENNET>than a third of all new U.S.

7381
06:27:39 --> 06:27:39
<v MR. BENNET>Electric generation in recent

7382
06:27:39 --> 06:27:40
<v MR. BENNET>years.

7383
06:27:40 --> 06:27:43
<v MR. BENNET>in colorado alone,

7384
06:27:43 --> 06:27:47
<v MR. BENNET>Mr. President, I can tell you it

7385
06:27:47 --> 06:27:51
<v MR. BENNET>has reed 6,000 jobs in my state.

7386
06:27:51 --> 06:27:54
<v MR. BENNET>It has moved our state toward a

7387
06:27:54 --> 06:27:57
<v MR. BENNET>more diversified and cleaner

7388
06:27:57 --> 06:27:59
<v MR. BENNET>energy portfolio so that

7389
06:27:59 --> 06:28:00
<v MR. BENNET>colorado today is a leader among

7390
06:28:01 --> 06:28:02
<v MR. BENNET>the 50 states in diversifying

7391
06:28:02 --> 06:28:03
<v MR. BENNET>our portfolio.

7392
06:28:03 --> 06:28:04
<v MR. BENNET>Let's be clear, we have oil and

7393
06:28:04 --> 06:28:07
<v MR. BENNET>we have coal and we have natural

7394
06:28:07 --> 06:28:09
<v MR. BENNET>gas, we have abundant wind and

7395
06:28:09 --> 06:28:15
<v MR. BENNET>abundant sun and entrepreneurial

7396
06:28:15 --> 06:28:16
<v MR. BENNET>horsepower all across the front

7397
06:28:16 --> 06:28:17
<v MR. BENNET>range.

7398
06:28:17 --> 06:28:17
<v MR. BENNET>What we don't have is

7399
06:28:17 --> 06:28:20
<v MR. BENNET>washington's cooperation.

7400
06:28:20 --> 06:28:21
<v MR. BENNET>What we don't have is the

7401
06:28:21 --> 06:28:23
<v MR. BENNET>decency of people coming

7402
06:28:23 --> 06:28:24
<v MR. BENNET>together and doing better and

7403
06:28:24 --> 06:28:25
<v MR. BENNET>keeping the flickering lights on

7404
06:28:25 --> 06:28:26
<v MR. BENNET>in this place.

7405
06:28:26 --> 06:28:27
<v MR. BENNET>And it's because they can't get

7406
06:28:27 --> 06:28:29
<v MR. BENNET>any certainty out of washington

7407
06:28:29 --> 06:28:30
<v MR. BENNET>that developers and

7408
06:28:30 --> 06:28:32
<v MR. BENNET>manufacturers are already

7409
06:28:32 --> 06:28:33
<v MR. BENNET>starting layoffs, already in

7410
06:28:33 --> 06:28:35
<v MR. BENNET>anticipation of the credit

7411
06:28:35 --> 06:28:35
<v MR. BENNET>expiring at the end of this

7412
06:28:35 --> 06:28:36
<v MR. BENNET>year.

7413
06:28:36 --> 06:28:39
<v MR. BENNET>This is the result of nothing

7414
06:28:39 --> 06:28:45
<v MR. BENNET>other than our political

7415
06:28:45 --> 06:28:47
<v MR. BENNET>dysfunction in washington.

7416
06:28:47 --> 06:28:49
<v MR. BENNET>Vestus, which has a huge

7417
06:28:49 --> 06:28:50
<v MR. BENNET>manufacturing footprint in

7418
06:28:50 --> 06:28:54
<v MR. BENNET>colorado, from windsor all the

7419
06:28:54 --> 06:28:56
<v MR. BENNET>way south to pueblo is poised to

7420
06:28:56 --> 06:29:00
<v MR. BENNET>play off 1,600 workers if we

7421
06:29:00 --> 06:29:02
<v MR. BENNET>fail to act.

7422
06:29:02 --> 06:29:03
<v MR. BENNET>ebrair renewables already doing

7423
06:29:03 --> 06:29:06
<v MR. BENNET>business in colorado has already

7424
06:29:06 --> 06:29:07
<v MR. BENNET>laid off 50 employees, if for no

7425
06:29:07 --> 06:29:10
<v MR. BENNET>reason other than our inability

7426
06:29:10 --> 06:29:10
<v MR. BENNET>to get our work done.

7427
06:29:11 --> 06:29:12
<v MR. BENNET>Nationally, 37,000 jobs are at

7428
06:29:12 --> 06:29:15
<v MR. BENNET>risk, not to mention the ones we

7429
06:29:15 --> 06:29:17
<v MR. BENNET>could have created after 2012

7430
06:29:17 --> 06:29:17
<v MR. BENNET>but won't if we let this credit

7431
06:29:17 --> 06:29:18
<v MR. BENNET>expire.

7432
06:29:18 --> 06:29:21
<v MR. BENNET>I brought a couple of other

7433
06:29:21 --> 06:29:23
<v MR. BENNET>pictures just to make sure

7434
06:29:23 --> 06:29:27
<v MR. BENNET>people know this is distributed

7435
06:29:27 --> 06:29:30
<v MR. BENNET>all over the united states.

7436
06:29:30 --> 06:29:34
<v MR. BENNET>Pennsylvania.

7437
06:29:34 --> 06:29:36
<v MR. BENNET>And in texas.

7438
06:29:36 --> 06:29:38
<v MR. BENNET>I know I sound like a broken

7439
06:29:38 --> 06:29:40
<v MR. BENNET>record when I say this because

7440
06:29:40 --> 06:29:43
<v MR. BENNET>I've said it over and over again

7441
06:29:43 --> 06:29:45
<v MR. BENNET>on this floor, but we should not

7442
06:29:45 --> 06:29:46
<v MR. BENNET>be confused that the rest of the

7443
06:29:46 --> 06:29:49
<v MR. BENNET>world is somehow waiting for us

7444
06:29:49 --> 06:29:51
<v MR. BENNET>to get our act together, that

7445
06:29:51 --> 06:29:53
<v MR. BENNET>they are somehow waiting for us

7446
06:29:53 --> 06:29:56
<v MR. BENNET>to cure our politics and do

7447
06:29:56 --> 06:29:58
<v MR. BENNET>something that will actually

7448
06:29:58 --> 06:29:59
<v MR. BENNET>solve for those curves that I

7449
06:29:59 --> 06:30:01
<v MR. BENNET>started earlier and put

7450
06:30:01 --> 06:30:02
<v MR. BENNET>americans back to work

7451
06:30:02 --> 06:30:05
<v MR. BENNET>manufacturing in jobs that are

7452
06:30:05 --> 06:30:06
<v MR. BENNET>actually driving middle-class

7453
06:30:06 --> 06:30:09
<v MR. BENNET>family income up rather than

7454
06:30:09 --> 06:30:09
<v MR. BENNET>down, which is what we're doing

7455
06:30:09 --> 06:30:12
<v MR. BENNET>today.

7456
06:30:12 --> 06:30:15
<v MR. BENNET>Our largest single export from

7457
06:30:15 --> 06:30:15
<v MR. BENNET>the united states of america is

7458
06:30:15 --> 06:30:20
<v MR. BENNET>aircraft.

7459
06:30:20 --> 06:30:22
<v MR. BENNET>We export $30 billion a year.

7460
06:30:22 --> 06:30:28
<v MR. BENNET>china's export of solar panels

7461
06:30:28 --> 06:30:32
<v MR. BENNET>last year was $15 billion.

7462
06:30:32 --> 06:30:33
<v MR. BENNET>Half, half our largest single

7463
06:30:33 --> 06:30:35
<v MR. BENNET>export.

7464
06:30:35 --> 06:30:37
<v MR. BENNET>They didn't export one solar

7465
06:30:37 --> 06:30:38
<v MR. BENNET>panel ten years ago, and we

7466
06:30:38 --> 06:30:38
<v MR. BENNET>invented the technology here in

7467
06:30:38 --> 06:30:40
<v MR. BENNET>the united states.

7468
06:30:40 --> 06:30:41
<v MR. BENNET>In fact, some of us believe that

7469
06:30:41 --> 06:30:44
<v MR. BENNET>we invented that technology in

7470
06:30:44 --> 06:30:46
<v MR. BENNET>the state of colorado.

7471
06:30:46 --> 06:30:47
<v MR. BENNET>I'm sure the chinese would love

7472
06:30:48 --> 06:30:49
<v MR. BENNET>to have this business as well,

7473
06:30:50 --> 06:30:53
<v MR. BENNET>and my concern is not that this

7474
06:30:53 --> 06:30:55
<v MR. BENNET>is a temporary interruption in

7475
06:30:55 --> 06:30:57
<v MR. BENNET>our wind industry but this will

7476
06:30:57 --> 06:31:01
<v MR. BENNET>become a permanent shutdown of

7477
06:31:01 --> 06:31:02
<v MR. BENNET>our ability to drive economic

7478
06:31:02 --> 06:31:05
<v MR. BENNET>growth across the country and

7479
06:31:05 --> 06:31:08
<v MR. BENNET>across the united states.

7480
06:31:08 --> 06:31:10
<v MR. BENNET>This is a perfect example of an

7481
06:31:10 --> 06:31:11
<v MR. BENNET>industry that can move this

7482
06:31:11 --> 06:31:12
<v MR. BENNET>unemployment level back up.

7483
06:31:12 --> 06:31:14
<v MR. BENNET>An iustry that we don't have

7484
06:31:14 --> 06:31:17
<v MR. BENNET>today, one that's in its

7485
06:31:17 --> 06:31:20
<v MR. BENNET>infancy but 50 years from now or

7486
06:31:20 --> 06:31:21
<v MR. BENNET>20 years from now May be driving

7487
06:31:21 --> 06:31:22
<v MR. BENNET>significant employment growth

7488
06:31:22 --> 06:31:23
<v MR. BENNET>across the united states of

7489
06:31:23 --> 06:31:24
<v MR. BENNET>america.

7490
06:31:24 --> 06:31:27
<v MR. BENNET>an industry that, by the way,

7491
06:31:27 --> 06:31:27
<v MR. BENNET>would drive this curve up as

7492
06:31:27 --> 06:31:30
<v MR. BENNET>well.

7493
06:31:30 --> 06:31:31
<v MR. BENNET>I met a young man in logan

7494
06:31:31 --> 06:31:33
<v MR. BENNET>county not long ago who was

7495
06:31:33 --> 06:31:35
<v MR. BENNET>working on -- he was giving me

7496
06:31:35 --> 06:31:35
<v MR. BENNET>a tour to the top of a wind

7497
06:31:35 --> 06:31:37
<v MR. BENNET>turbine.

7498
06:31:37 --> 06:31:38
<v MR. BENNET>I was standing on the very top

7499
06:31:38 --> 06:31:41
<v MR. BENNET>of the box.

7500
06:31:41 --> 06:31:41
<v MR. BENNET>It was about 10,000 feet in the

7501
06:31:41 --> 06:31:42
<v MR. BENNET>air, Mr. President.

7502
06:31:42 --> 06:31:44
<v MR. BENNET>Or felt that way to me.

7503
06:31:44 --> 06:31:45
<v MR. BENNET>i was wearing the shoes that I'm

7504
06:31:45 --> 06:31:47
<v MR. BENNET>wearing right now on the floor

7505
06:31:47 --> 06:31:48
<v MR. BENNET>of the senate, which is not

7506
06:31:48 --> 06:31:50
<v MR. BENNET>what you should wear when you're

7507
06:31:50 --> 06:31:54
<v MR. BENNET>at the top of a wind turbine

7508
06:31:54 --> 06:31:55
<v MR. BENNET>that swang in the wind, at the

7509
06:31:55 --> 06:31:57
<v MR. BENNET>border of colorado.

7510
06:31:57 --> 06:32:00
<v MR. BENNET>But he told me that he would be

7511
06:32:00 --> 06:32:02
<v MR. BENNET>unable to live in his home

7512
06:32:02 --> 06:32:03
<v MR. BENNET>community and raise his family

7513
06:32:03 --> 06:32:05
<v MR. BENNET>in this home community if it

7514
06:32:05 --> 06:32:07
<v MR. BENNET>hadn't been for that job, a job

7515
06:32:07 --> 06:32:09
<v MR. BENNET>that he couldn't have even

7516
06:32:09 --> 06:32:10
<v MR. BENNET>imagined there being five years

7517
06:32:10 --> 06:32:12
<v MR. BENNET>ago.

7518
06:32:12 --> 06:32:14
<v MR. BENNET>And there it is today.

7519
06:32:14 --> 06:32:15
<v MR. BENNET>These are high quality,

7520
06:32:15 --> 06:32:16
<v MR. BENNET>high-paying jobs in the united

7521
06:32:16 --> 06:32:18
<v MR. BENNET>states of america, and it would

7522
06:32:18 --> 06:32:18
<v MR. BENNET>seem to me that the united

7523
06:32:18 --> 06:32:21
<v MR. BENNET>states congress ought to figure

7524
06:32:21 --> 06:32:22
<v MR. BENNET>out a way to support these

7525
06:32:22 --> 06:32:24
<v MR. BENNET>industries.

7526
06:32:24 --> 06:32:25
<v MR. BENNET>I actually don't believe any of

7527
06:32:25 --> 06:32:25
<v MR. BENNET>these kinds of credits should be

7528
06:32:25 --> 06:32:27
<v MR. BENNET>permanent.

7529
06:32:27 --> 06:32:29
<v MR. BENNET>I want to be clear about that.

7530
06:32:29 --> 06:32:31
<v MR. BENNET>I think that we would be doing

7531
06:32:31 --> 06:32:33
<v MR. BENNET>ourselves and the country a

7532
06:32:33 --> 06:32:35
<v MR. BENNET>service if we design them in a

7533
06:32:35 --> 06:32:37
<v MR. BENNET>way that phased out over time

7534
06:32:37 --> 06:32:40
<v MR. BENNET>because at a certain point,

7535
06:32:40 --> 06:32:43
<v MR. BENNET>every business has to sink or

7536
06:32:43 --> 06:32:45
<v MR. BENNET>swim based on its merits.

7537
06:32:45 --> 06:32:48
<v MR. BENNET>and we're this close to being

7538
06:32:48 --> 06:32:50
<v MR. BENNET>there with wind production.

7539
06:32:50 --> 06:32:53
<v MR. BENNET>And we're this close to turning

7540
06:32:53 --> 06:32:55
<v MR. BENNET>it over to the rest of the

7541
06:32:55 --> 06:32:58
<v MR. BENNET>world.

7542
06:32:58 --> 06:33:01
<v MR. BENNET>This is not a partisan issue.

7543
06:33:01 --> 06:33:02
<v MR. BENNET>This is not a partisan issue.

7544
06:33:02 --> 06:33:05
<v MR. BENNET>Last week, republicans and

7545
06:33:05 --> 06:33:06
<v MR. BENNET>democrats from the colorado

7546
06:33:06 --> 06:33:08
<v MR. BENNET>delegation came together in the

7547
06:33:08 --> 06:33:10
<v MR. BENNET>house and the senate to urge a

7548
06:33:10 --> 06:33:11
<v MR. BENNET>quick extension as part of the

7549
06:33:11 --> 06:33:12
<v MR. BENNET>payroll deal and,

7550
06:33:12 --> 06:33:14
<v MR. BENNET>Mr. President, with your

7551
06:33:14 --> 06:33:15
<v MR. BENNET>permission, I'd like to submit

7552
06:33:15 --> 06:33:15
<v MR. BENNET>that letter for the record.

7553
06:33:15 --> 06:33:17
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

7554
06:33:17 --> 06:33:17
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

7555
06:33:18 --> 06:33:19
<v MR. BENNET>I know my

7556
06:33:19 --> 06:33:21
<v MR. BENNET>colleagues, senator harkin and

7557
06:33:21 --> 06:33:24
<v MR. BENNET>senator grassley, did the same

7558
06:33:24 --> 06:33:25
<v MR. BENNET>with the delegation from iowa.

7559
06:33:25 --> 06:33:27
<v MR. BENNET>in fact, as I recall senator

7560
06:33:27 --> 06:33:30
<v MR. BENNET>grassley was actually the one

7561
06:33:30 --> 06:33:31
<v MR. BENNET>that wrote this to begin with.

7562
06:33:31 --> 06:33:34
<v MR. BENNET>We've also recently filed an

7563
06:33:34 --> 06:33:37
<v MR. BENNET>amendment, a bipartisan fully

7564
06:33:37 --> 06:33:38
<v MR. BENNET>paid for, fully paid for

7565
06:33:38 --> 06:33:40
<v MR. BENNET>one-year extension of the credit

7566
06:33:40 --> 06:33:40
<v MR. BENNET>to the service

7567
06:33:40 --> 06:33:41
<v MR. BENNET>transportation -- surface

7568
06:33:41 --> 06:33:43
<v MR. BENNET>transportation bill, and I'd

7569
06:33:43 --> 06:33:45
<v MR. BENNET>like to thank senator moran, a

7570
06:33:45 --> 06:33:47
<v MR. BENNET>republican from kansas, for

7571
06:33:47 --> 06:33:47
<v MR. BENNET>joining me to lead that

7572
06:33:47 --> 06:33:50
<v MR. BENNET>amendment.

7573
06:33:50 --> 06:33:53
<v MR. BENNET>So there's plenty of support out

7574
06:33:53 --> 06:33:55
<v MR. BENNET>there for us to get this done.

7575
06:33:55 --> 06:33:56
<v MR. BENNET>And more important to that --

7576
06:33:56 --> 06:33:57
<v MR. BENNET>than that, Mr. President, there

7577
06:33:57 --> 06:33:59
<v MR. BENNET>are thousands of people that are

7578
06:33:59 --> 06:34:01
<v MR. BENNET>going to have to go home if we

7579
06:34:01 --> 06:34:03
<v MR. BENNET>don't act to their families and

7580
06:34:03 --> 06:34:04
<v MR. BENNET>say that they were laid off of

7581
06:34:04 --> 06:34:06
<v MR. BENNET>their job for no reason other

7582
06:34:06 --> 06:34:08
<v MR. BENNET>than the political dysfunction

7583
06:34:08 --> 06:34:13
<v MR. BENNET>here in washington, D.C.

7584
06:34:13 --> 06:34:16
<v MR. BENNET>And I think enough is enough.

7585
06:34:16 --> 06:34:18
<v MR. BENNET>I cannot tell you how much I

7586
06:34:18 --> 06:34:23
<v MR. BENNET>look forward to a time when we

7587
06:34:23 --> 06:34:25
<v MR. BENNET>have a thoughtful, bipartisan,

7588
06:34:25 --> 06:34:26
<v MR. BENNET>fact-based tax reform in this

7589
06:34:26 --> 06:34:27
<v MR. BENNET>congress.

7590
06:34:27 --> 06:34:30
<v MR. BENNET>when we are thinking about our

7591
06:34:30 --> 06:34:31
<v MR. BENNET>tax code and our regulatory code

7592
06:34:31 --> 06:34:33
<v MR. BENNET>and asking ourselves, are we

7593
06:34:33 --> 06:34:35
<v MR. BENNET>driving job growth here in the

7594
06:34:35 --> 06:34:37
<v MR. BENNET>united states with these

7595
06:34:37 --> 06:34:38
<v MR. BENNET>policies, are we driving

7596
06:34:38 --> 06:34:40
<v MR. BENNET>middle-class family income up

7597
06:34:40 --> 06:34:43
<v MR. BENNET>with these policies?

7598
06:34:43 --> 06:34:45
<v MR. BENNET>Are we addressing the income

7599
06:34:45 --> 06:34:47
<v MR. BENNET>inequality gap by having an

7600
06:34:47 --> 06:34:48
<v MR. BENNET>economy that truly does lift all

7601
06:34:48 --> 06:34:51
<v MR. BENNET>ships?

7602
06:34:51 --> 06:34:53
<v MR. BENNET>And as the President Would make

7603
06:34:53 --> 06:34:54
<v MR. BENNET>the point, are we dealing with

7604
06:34:54 --> 06:34:57
<v MR. BENNET>the fiscal challenges that this

7605
06:34:57 --> 06:34:58
<v MR. BENNET>country faces so that we don't

7606
06:34:58 --> 06:34:59
<v MR. BENNET>strap our kids with this

7607
06:34:59 --> 06:35:01
<v MR. BENNET>mountain of debt?

7608
06:35:01 --> 06:35:02
<v MR. BENNET>I know there are people on both

7609
06:35:02 --> 06:35:04
<v MR. BENNET>sides of the aisle that are

7610
06:35:04 --> 06:35:08
<v MR. BENNET>anxious to work on this, but we

7611
06:35:08 --> 06:35:10
<v MR. BENNET>have failed that test in this

7612
06:35:10 --> 06:35:12
<v MR. BENNET>compromise measure, and it is

7613
06:35:12 --> 06:35:14
<v MR. BENNET>my hope that at some point in

7614
06:35:14 --> 06:35:16
<v MR. BENNET>the near future we can get in a

7615
06:35:16 --> 06:35:18
<v MR. BENNET>vote on this amendment, senator

7616
06:35:18 --> 06:35:19
<v MR. BENNET>moran's amendment, and we can

7617
06:35:19 --> 06:35:21
<v MR. BENNET>put americans back to work in

7618
06:35:21 --> 06:35:22
<v MR. BENNET>these industries before we lose

7619
06:35:22 --> 06:35:23
<v MR. BENNET>them forever.

7620
06:35:23 --> 06:35:27
<v MR. BENNET>Mr. President, with that, i

7621
06:35:27 --> 06:35:28
<v MR. BENNET>yield the floor.

7622
06:35:28 --> 06:35:29
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

7623
06:35:29 --> 06:35:30
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senator from mississippi.

7624
06:35:31 --> 06:35:32
<v MR. WICKER>are we in morning

7625
06:35:32 --> 06:35:34
<v MR. WICKER>business or do I have to ask

7626
06:35:34 --> 06:35:35
<v MR. WICKER>unanimous consent to speak as if

7627
06:35:35 --> 06:35:36
<v MR. WICKER>in morning business?

7628
06:35:36 --> 06:35:38
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>we are on

7629
06:35:38 --> 06:35:39
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the bill, sir.

7630
06:35:39 --> 06:35:40
<v MR. WICKER>I ask unanimous

7631
06:35:40 --> 06:35:40
<v MR. WICKER>consent to speak as if in

7632
06:35:40 --> 06:35:41
<v MR. WICKER>morning business.

7633
06:35:41 --> 06:35:42
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

7634
06:35:42 --> 06:35:43
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

7635
06:35:43 --> 06:35:44
<v MR. WICKER>Mr. President,

7636
06:35:44 --> 06:35:47
<v MR. WICKER>I -- thank you.

7637
06:35:47 --> 06:35:49
<v MR. WICKER>I came to the floor previously

7638
06:35:49 --> 06:35:52
<v MR. WICKER>to speak about President Obama's

7639
06:35:52 --> 06:35:54
<v MR. WICKER>unconstitutional appointments of

7640
06:35:54 --> 06:35:56
<v MR. WICKER>richard cordray as director of

7641
06:35:56 --> 06:35:57
<v MR. WICKER>the consumer financial

7642
06:35:57 --> 06:36:00
<v MR. WICKER>protection bureau, and of three

7643
06:36:00 --> 06:36:02
<v MR. WICKER>new members to the national

7644
06:36:02 --> 06:36:05
<v MR. WICKER>labor relations board.

7645
06:36:05 --> 06:36:06
<v MR. WICKER>I spoke about why this blatant

7646
06:36:07 --> 06:36:07
<v MR. WICKER>overstep of executive authority

7647
06:36:08 --> 06:36:09
<v MR. WICKER>violates the President's right

7648
06:36:09 --> 06:36:11
<v MR. WICKER>to make recess appointments

7649
06:36:11 --> 06:36:13
<v MR. WICKER>under article 2, section 2 of

7650
06:36:13 --> 06:36:15
<v MR. WICKER>the constitution.

7651
06:36:15 --> 06:36:17
<v MR. WICKER>I described its unequivocal

7652
06:36:17 --> 06:36:19
<v MR. WICKER>reversal of years of precedent

7653
06:36:19 --> 06:36:20
<v MR. WICKER>which the obama justice

7654
06:36:20 --> 06:36:22
<v MR. WICKER>department office of legal

7655
06:36:22 --> 06:36:23
<v MR. WICKER>counsel has since defended,

7656
06:36:23 --> 06:36:26
<v MR. WICKER>essentially stating that pro

7657
06:36:26 --> 06:36:27
<v MR. WICKER>forma sessions no longer matter.

7658
06:36:27 --> 06:36:29
<v MR. WICKER>Mr. President, this issue is

7659
06:36:29 --> 06:36:32
<v MR. WICKER>far from over.

7660
06:36:32 --> 06:36:34
<v MR. WICKER>We cannot allow it simply to go

7661
06:36:34 --> 06:36:36
<v MR. WICKER>away, and the illegal

7662
06:36:36 --> 06:36:39
<v MR. WICKER>appointments must eventually be

7663
06:36:39 --> 06:36:40
<v MR. WICKER>set aside.

7664
06:36:41 --> 06:36:43
<v MR. WICKER>The 23-page justice department

7665
06:36:43 --> 06:36:46
<v MR. WICKER>opinion written by assistant

7666
06:36:46 --> 06:36:48
<v MR. WICKER>attorney general virginia a.

7667
06:36:48 --> 06:36:50
<v MR. WICKER>Sykes wrongly advises that

7668
06:36:50 --> 06:36:51
<v MR. WICKER>despite the convening of pro

7669
06:36:51 --> 06:36:53
<v MR. WICKER>forma sessions, the President

7670
06:36:53 --> 06:36:55
<v MR. WICKER>-- quote -- &quot;has discretion to

7671
06:36:55 --> 06:36:57
<v MR. WICKER>conclude that the senate is

7672
06:36:57 --> 06:36:58
<v MR. WICKER>unable to perform its advise and

7673
06:36:58 --> 06:37:01
<v MR. WICKER>consent function and to exercise

7674
06:37:01 --> 06:37:03
<v MR. WICKER>his power to make recess

7675
06:37:03 --> 06:37:07
<v MR. WICKER>appointments&quot; -- unquote.

7676
06:37:07 --> 06:37:10
<v MR. WICKER>Under this misguided opinion the

7677
06:37:10 --> 06:37:16
<v MR. WICKER>obama administration is, is

7678
06:37:16 --> 06:37:17
<v MR. WICKER>suggesting that the executive

7679
06:37:17 --> 06:37:20
<v MR. WICKER>branch canned determine when

7680
06:37:20 --> 06:37:23
<v MR. WICKER>congress is not in session.

7681
06:37:23 --> 06:37:25
<v MR. WICKER>It I'm deeply concerned that

7682
06:37:25 --> 06:37:26
<v MR. WICKER>this prumpt twus action by at

7683
06:37:26 --> 06:37:28
<v MR. WICKER>the present time proposes

7684
06:37:28 --> 06:37:28
<v MR. WICKER>profound and dangerous

7685
06:37:28 --> 06:37:30
<v MR. WICKER>implication.

7686
06:37:30 --> 06:37:31
<v MR. WICKER>as others have suggested,

7687
06:37:31 --> 06:37:33
<v MR. WICKER>President Obama's abuse of this

7688
06:37:33 --> 06:37:35
<v MR. WICKER>recess appointment power could

7689
06:37:35 --> 06:37:38
<v MR. WICKER>lead to unilateral recess

7690
06:37:38 --> 06:37:39
<v MR. WICKER>appointments any time, such as

7691
06:37:39 --> 06:37:40
<v MR. WICKER>during lunch or in the middle of

7692
06:37:40 --> 06:37:43
<v MR. WICKER>the night.

7693
06:37:43 --> 06:37:43
<v MR. WICKER>This is not that far-fetched,

7694
06:37:43 --> 06:37:44
<v MR. WICKER>Mr. President.

7695
06:37:44 --> 06:37:48
<v MR. WICKER>As I've said before it is my

7696
06:37:48 --> 06:37:50
<v MR. WICKER>hope that both parties will rise

7697
06:37:50 --> 06:37:52
<v MR. WICKER>to defend the separated powers

7698
06:37:52 --> 06:37:54
<v MR. WICKER>our founders put in place, to

7699
06:37:54 --> 06:37:55
<v MR. WICKER>prevent tyranny and the misuse

7700
06:37:55 --> 06:37:57
<v MR. WICKER>of authority.

7701
06:37:57 --> 06:37:58
<v MR. WICKER>It is worth repeating that the

7702
06:37:58 --> 06:37:59
<v MR. WICKER>controversy surrounding the

7703
06:37:59 --> 06:38:01
<v MR. WICKER>President's nonrecess

7704
06:38:01 --> 06:38:03
<v MR. WICKER>appointments has nothing to do

7705
06:38:03 --> 06:38:05
<v MR. WICKER>with the personal character of

7706
06:38:05 --> 06:38:07
<v MR. WICKER>Mr. Cordray or those named to

7707
06:38:07 --> 06:38:09
<v MR. WICKER>the nlrb nor is the debate over

7708
06:38:09 --> 06:38:10
<v MR. WICKER>the appointments when the senate

7709
06:38:10 --> 06:38:13
<v MR. WICKER>is in recess.

7710
06:38:13 --> 06:38:17
<v MR. WICKER>What the President Has done

7711
06:38:17 --> 06:38:17
<v MR. WICKER>transcends party issues anded

7712
06:38:17 --> 06:38:18
<v MR. WICKER>ideological divides.

7713
06:38:19 --> 06:38:20
<v MR. WICKER>A day after the appointments

7714
06:38:21 --> 06:38:23
<v MR. WICKER>were made, former attorney

7715
06:38:23 --> 06:38:29
<v MR. WICKER>general edwin middle east

7716
06:38:29 --> 06:38:30
<v MR. WICKER>iii and -- meese iii and todd

7717
06:38:30 --> 06:38:31
<v MR. WICKER>gaziano wrote in &quot;the washington

7718
06:38:31 --> 06:38:33
<v MR. WICKER>post&quot; that President Obama's

7719
06:38:33 --> 06:38:37
<v MR. WICKER>move is -- quote -- &quot;a

7720
06:38:37 --> 06:38:38
<v MR. WICKER>constitutional abuse of a high

7721
06:38:38 --> 06:38:41
<v MR. WICKER>order&quot; -- unquote.

7722
06:38:41 --> 06:38:43
<v MR. WICKER>It challenges 225 years of

7723
06:38:43 --> 06:38:45
<v MR. WICKER>executive practice.

7724
06:38:45 --> 06:38:47
<v MR. WICKER>The constitution is very clear

7725
06:38:47 --> 06:38:49
<v MR. WICKER>in its delegation of powers.

7726
06:38:49 --> 06:38:52
<v MR. WICKER>It explicitly grants the senate

7727
06:38:52 --> 06:38:54
<v MR. WICKER>the exclusive responsibility to

7728
06:38:54 --> 06:38:57
<v MR. WICKER>give advice and consent.

7729
06:38:57 --> 06:38:58
<v MR. WICKER>On treaties and nominations.

7730
06:38:58 --> 06:39:01
<v MR. WICKER>It endouse the President With

7731
06:39:01 --> 06:39:02
<v MR. WICKER>the right to fill vacancies when

7732
06:39:02 --> 06:39:04
<v MR. WICKER>the senate is not in session, a

7733
06:39:04 --> 06:39:05
<v MR. WICKER>provision conceived by the

7734
06:39:05 --> 06:39:07
<v MR. WICKER>framers as a way to keep the

7735
06:39:07 --> 06:39:09
<v MR. WICKER>government operational when the

7736
06:39:09 --> 06:39:10
<v MR. WICKER>ability of senators to

7737
06:39:10 --> 06:39:12
<v MR. WICKER>communicate with the executive

7738
06:39:12 --> 06:39:14
<v MR. WICKER>branch and travel back to the

7739
06:39:14 --> 06:39:15
<v MR. WICKER>capitol took much longer than

7740
06:39:15 --> 06:39:16
<v MR. WICKER>today.

7741
06:39:16 --> 06:39:18
<v MR. WICKER>Of course it is disappointing

7742
06:39:18 --> 06:39:20
<v MR. WICKER>that President Obama has

7743
06:39:20 --> 06:39:23
<v MR. WICKER>dismissed the will of the

7744
06:39:23 --> 06:39:26
<v MR. WICKER>senate, which had rejected

7745
06:39:26 --> 06:39:28
<v MR. WICKER>Mr. Cordray's nomination, just

7746
06:39:28 --> 06:39:30
<v MR. WICKER>last December.

7747
06:39:30 --> 06:39:33
<v MR. WICKER>But never before has a president

7748
06:39:33 --> 06:39:36
<v MR. WICKER>assumed the authority to issue

7749
06:39:36 --> 06:39:39
<v MR. WICKER>recess appointments when the

7750
06:39:39 --> 06:39:41
<v MR. WICKER>senate was not in recess.

7751
06:39:41 --> 06:39:44
<v MR. WICKER>And doing -- in doing so, the

7752
06:39:44 --> 06:39:47
<v MR. WICKER>President Is violating the

7753
06:39:47 --> 06:39:48
<v MR. WICKER>constitution, plain and simple.

7754
06:39:48 --> 06:39:50
<v MR. WICKER>And invalidating the legitimacy

7755
06:39:50 --> 06:39:53
<v MR. WICKER>of his appointees.

7756
06:39:53 --> 06:39:56
<v MR. WICKER>it stands to reason that any

7757
06:39:56 --> 06:39:58
<v MR. WICKER>decisions of the cfpb or the

7758
06:39:58 --> 06:40:00
<v MR. WICKER>nlrb will be subject to the same

7759
06:40:00 --> 06:40:02
<v MR. WICKER>shroud of unconstitutionality

7760
06:40:02 --> 06:40:04
<v MR. WICKER>and legal contest.

7761
06:40:04 --> 06:40:06
<v MR. WICKER>The constitution and nearly a

7762
06:40:06 --> 06:40:08
<v MR. WICKER>century of legal opinion provide

7763
06:40:08 --> 06:40:11
<v MR. WICKER>a solid basis for determining

7764
06:40:11 --> 06:40:14
<v MR. WICKER>the parameters of what qualifies

7765
06:40:14 --> 06:40:15
<v MR. WICKER>as a legislative recess.

7766
06:40:15 --> 06:40:17
<v MR. WICKER>Which is required for the

7767
06:40:17 --> 06:40:18
<v MR. WICKER>President To invoke his

7768
06:40:18 --> 06:40:21
<v MR. WICKER>appointment privileges.

7769
06:40:21 --> 06:40:22
<v MR. WICKER>Under article 1, section 5,

7770
06:40:22 --> 06:40:23
<v MR. WICKER>clause 4 of the constitution,

7771
06:40:23 --> 06:40:25
<v MR. WICKER>the house of representatives

7772
06:40:25 --> 06:40:27
<v MR. WICKER>must grant its consent in order

7773
06:40:27 --> 06:40:28
<v MR. WICKER>for the senate to adjourn longer

7774
06:40:28 --> 06:40:29
<v MR. WICKER>than three days.

7775
06:40:29 --> 06:40:31
<v MR. WICKER>The senate must do the same for

7776
06:40:31 --> 06:40:34
<v MR. WICKER>the house.

7777
06:40:34 --> 06:40:35
<v MR. WICKER>it is an undisputed fact that

7778
06:40:35 --> 06:40:37
<v MR. WICKER>the house of representatives did

7779
06:40:37 --> 06:40:38
<v MR. WICKER>not give this chamber that

7780
06:40:38 --> 06:40:40
<v MR. WICKER>consent, and in keeping with

7781
06:40:40 --> 06:40:41
<v MR. WICKER>the constitution, this senate

7782
06:40:41 --> 06:40:43
<v MR. WICKER>did not adjourn for more than

7783
06:40:43 --> 06:40:45
<v MR. WICKER>three days.

7784
06:40:45 --> 06:40:47
<v MR. WICKER>The President's claim that a

7785
06:40:47 --> 06:40:50
<v MR. WICKER>brief adjournment can be called

7786
06:40:50 --> 06:40:52
<v MR. WICKER>a recess goes against 90 years

7787
06:40:52 --> 06:40:54
<v MR. WICKER>of legal opinion.

7788
06:40:54 --> 06:40:59
<v MR. WICKER>In 1921, President Harding's

7789
06:40:59 --> 06:41:00
<v MR. WICKER>attorney general, harry m.

7790
06:41:00 --> 06:41:02
<v MR. WICKER>Doingerty had this to say about

7791
06:41:02 --> 06:41:02
<v MR. WICKER>what defines a recess and I

7792
06:41:02 --> 06:41:05
<v MR. WICKER>quote.

7793
06:41:05 --> 06:41:07
<v MR. WICKER>No one, by venture to say would

7794
06:41:07 --> 06:41:09
<v MR. WICKER>for a moment contend that the

7795
06:41:09 --> 06:41:10
<v MR. WICKER>senate is not in session when an

7796
06:41:10 --> 06:41:12
<v MR. WICKER>adjournment of two days is

7797
06:41:12 --> 06:41:14
<v MR. WICKER>taken, nor do I think an

7798
06:41:14 --> 06:41:16
<v MR. WICKER>adjournment for five or even ten

7799
06:41:16 --> 06:41:20
<v MR. WICKER>days can be said to constitute

7800
06:41:20 --> 06:41:23
<v MR. WICKER>the recess intended by the

7801
06:41:23 --> 06:41:24
<v MR. WICKER>constitution, unquote.

7802
06:41:24 --> 06:41:26
<v MR. WICKER>Since then attorneys general and

7803
06:41:26 --> 06:41:29
<v MR. WICKER>presidents of both parties have

7804
06:41:29 --> 06:41:31
<v MR. WICKER>agreed to that at -- agreed

7805
06:41:31 --> 06:41:33
<v MR. WICKER>that at least ten days should

7806
06:41:33 --> 06:41:33
<v MR. WICKER>pass before a recess is

7807
06:41:33 --> 06:41:35
<v MR. WICKER>acknowledged.

7808
06:41:35 --> 06:41:37
<v MR. WICKER>And yet as we are aware, there

7809
06:41:37 --> 06:41:39
<v MR. WICKER>were not ten days of adjournment

7810
06:41:39 --> 06:41:40
<v MR. WICKER>when President Obama made his

7811
06:41:40 --> 06:41:43
<v MR. WICKER>four appointments.

7812
06:41:43 --> 06:41:45
<v MR. WICKER>We were holding pro performa --

7813
06:41:45 --> 06:41:49
<v MR. WICKER>pro forma sessions, proceeding

7814
06:41:49 --> 06:41:50
<v MR. WICKER>just as the senate did in 2007

7815
06:41:50 --> 06:41:52
<v MR. WICKER>when majority leader reid wanted

7816
06:41:52 --> 06:41:55
<v MR. WICKER>to block President Bush from

7817
06:41:55 --> 06:42:00
<v MR. WICKER>making recess appointments.

7818
06:42:00 --> 06:42:01
<v MR. WICKER>And succeeded in doing so.

7819
06:42:01 --> 06:42:04
<v MR. WICKER>President Bush was prevented

7820
06:42:04 --> 06:42:06
<v MR. WICKER>from making those recess

7821
06:42:06 --> 06:42:06
<v MR. WICKER>appointments in similar

7822
06:42:06 --> 06:42:12
<v MR. WICKER>circumstances.

7823
06:42:12 --> 06:42:16
<v MR. WICKER>As edwin meese and todd gaziano

7824
06:42:16 --> 06:42:17
<v MR. WICKER>and in their op-ed, reid was

7825
06:42:17 --> 06:42:18
<v MR. WICKER>right, whether or not his

7826
06:42:18 --> 06:42:20
<v MR. WICKER>tactics were justified.

7827
06:42:20 --> 06:42:21
<v MR. WICKER>I agree.

7828
06:42:21 --> 06:42:23

7830
06:42:25 --> 06:42:25

<v MR. WICKER>after?

7871
06:43:47 --> 06:43:49
<v MR. WICKER>Based on this case, it appears

7872
06:43:49 --> 06:43:52
<v MR. WICKER>the validity of a senate session

7873
06:43:52 --> 06:43:52

7907
06:45:03 --> 06:45:05

7958
06:46:51 --> 06:46:53

7963
06:47:01 --> 06:47:03
<v MR. WICKER>The President Is certainly free

<v MR. WICKER>And yet in order to address

7976
06:47:20 --> 06:47:24

7992
06:47:46 --> 06:47:48
<v MR. WICKER>pledge to serve the american

7993
06:47:48 --> 06:47:52
<v MR. WICKER>people.

7994
06:47:52 --> 06:47:54
<v MR. WICKER>That's what motivated robert

7995
06:47:54 --> 06:47:55
<v MR. WICKER>byrd earlier and it's what ought

7996
06:47:55 --> 06:47:55
<v MR. WICKER>to motivate us today,

7997
06:47:55 --> 06:47:58
<v MR. WICKER>Mr. President.

7998
06:47:58 --> 06:48:00
<v MR. WICKER>Keeping that promise means

7999
06:48:00 --> 06:48:02
<v MR. WICKER>standing up for the sanctity of

8000
06:48:02 --> 06:48:04
<v MR. WICKER>our country's founding document

8001
06:48:04 --> 06:48:07
<v MR. WICKER>and the integrity of this

8002
06:48:07 --> 06:48:09
<v MR. WICKER>institution.

8003
06:48:09 --> 06:48:11
<v MR. WICKER>Thank you, Mr. President, and I

8004
06:48:11 --> 06:48:12
<v MR. WICKER>note the absence of a quorum.

8005
06:48:12 --> 06:48:18
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the clerk

8006
06:48:18 --> 06:48:18
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>will call the roll.

8007
07:22:45 --> 07:22:46
<v MR. CARDIN>Mr. President?

8008
07:22:46 --> 07:22:47
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

8009
07:22:47 --> 07:22:48
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senator from maryland.

8010
07:22:48 --> 07:22:49
<v MR. CARDIN>Mr. President, I

8011
07:22:49 --> 07:22:50
<v MR. CARDIN>ask unanimous consent that the

8012
07:22:50 --> 07:22:51
<v MR. CARDIN>quorum call be dispensed with.

8013
07:22:51 --> 07:22:52
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

8014
07:22:52 --> 07:22:52
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

8015
07:22:52 --> 07:22:55
<v MR. CARDIN>Mr. President, I

8016
07:22:55 --> 07:22:58
<v MR. CARDIN>take this time to talk about the

8017
07:22:58 --> 07:23:00
<v MR. CARDIN>conference committee that has

8018
07:23:00 --> 07:23:04
<v MR. CARDIN>been filed in regards to the

8019
07:23:04 --> 07:23:06
<v MR. CARDIN>extension of the payroll tax

8020
07:23:06 --> 07:23:08
<v MR. CARDIN>holiday, the medicare physician

8021
07:23:08 --> 07:23:11
<v MR. CARDIN>issues that our seniors can

8022
07:23:11 --> 07:23:14
<v MR. CARDIN>continue to have access to their

8023
07:23:14 --> 07:23:15
<v MR. CARDIN>doctors, and the extension of

8024
07:23:15 --> 07:23:17
<v MR. CARDIN>the unemployment insurance.

8025
07:23:17 --> 07:23:19
<v MR. CARDIN>I was appointed to that

8026
07:23:19 --> 07:23:21
<v MR. CARDIN>conference, and that conference

8027
07:23:21 --> 07:23:24
<v MR. CARDIN>has been meeting now for the

8028
07:23:24 --> 07:23:24
<v MR. CARDIN>better part of the last six to

8029
07:23:24 --> 07:23:27
<v MR. CARDIN>eight weeks.

8030
07:23:27 --> 07:23:28
<v MR. CARDIN>We are able to reach an

8031
07:23:28 --> 07:23:31
<v MR. CARDIN>agreement that was filed.

8032
07:23:31 --> 07:23:33
<v MR. CARDIN>I first want to compliment

8033
07:23:33 --> 07:23:35
<v MR. CARDIN>senator baucus, the senate chair

8034
07:23:35 --> 07:23:37
<v MR. CARDIN>of the conference committee.

8035
07:23:37 --> 07:23:38
<v MR. CARDIN>There was a real effort made

8036
07:23:38 --> 07:23:40
<v MR. CARDIN>that this conference would

8037
07:23:40 --> 07:23:41
<v MR. CARDIN>operate the way a conference

8038
07:23:41 --> 07:23:43
<v MR. CARDIN>should operate.

8039
07:23:43 --> 07:23:45
<v MR. CARDIN>and that is the house and senate

8040
07:23:45 --> 07:23:46
<v MR. CARDIN>members meeting, discussing the

8041
07:23:46 --> 07:23:48
<v MR. CARDIN>differences between the two

8042
07:23:48 --> 07:23:52
<v MR. CARDIN>bodies and trying to reconcile

8043
07:23:52 --> 07:23:53
<v MR. CARDIN>their differences in a somewhat

8044
07:23:53 --> 07:23:54
<v MR. CARDIN>open process.

8045
07:23:54 --> 07:23:56
<v MR. CARDIN>We had several open discussions

8046
07:23:56 --> 07:23:57
<v MR. CARDIN>where we talked about some of

8047
07:23:57 --> 07:23:58
<v MR. CARDIN>the issues.

8048
07:23:58 --> 07:24:02
<v MR. CARDIN>Each member of the conference

8049
07:24:02 --> 07:24:04
<v MR. CARDIN>had a chance to express himself

8050
07:24:04 --> 07:24:05
<v MR. CARDIN>on the issues, and we had a good

8051
07:24:05 --> 07:24:06
<v MR. CARDIN>exchange.

8052
07:24:06 --> 07:24:09
<v MR. CARDIN>And I think during that exchange

8053
07:24:09 --> 07:24:09
<v MR. CARDIN>we were able to reach some

8054
07:24:09 --> 07:24:11
<v MR. CARDIN>consensus.

8055
07:24:11 --> 07:24:12
<v MR. CARDIN>Almost immediately we reached a

8056
07:24:12 --> 07:24:14
<v MR. CARDIN>consensus that all of us wanted

8057
07:24:14 --> 07:24:16
<v MR. CARDIN>to make sure that the payroll

8058
07:24:16 --> 07:24:18
<v MR. CARDIN>tax holiday was extended.

8059
07:24:18 --> 07:24:20
<v MR. CARDIN>The payroll tax holiday provides

8060
07:24:20 --> 07:24:21
<v MR. CARDIN>tax relief for 160 million

8061
07:24:21 --> 07:24:24
<v MR. CARDIN>americans.

8062
07:24:24 --> 07:24:25
<v MR. CARDIN>this is not the time for

8063
07:24:25 --> 07:24:27
<v MR. CARDIN>paychecks to actually go down

8064
07:24:27 --> 07:24:28
<v MR. CARDIN>for american workers.

8065
07:24:28 --> 07:24:31
<v MR. CARDIN>We're trying to build confidence

8066
07:24:31 --> 07:24:31
<v MR. CARDIN>in the workplace, in the

8067
07:24:31 --> 07:24:33
<v MR. CARDIN>marketplace.

8068
07:24:33 --> 07:24:37
<v MR. CARDIN>And the more money in the

8069
07:24:37 --> 07:24:38
<v MR. CARDIN>paycheck allows people the

8070
07:24:38 --> 07:24:39
<v MR. CARDIN>opportunity to be better

8071
07:24:39 --> 07:24:39
<v MR. CARDIN>consumers, helping to create

8072
07:24:39 --> 07:24:41
<v MR. CARDIN>jobs.

8073
07:24:41 --> 07:24:42
<v MR. CARDIN>There was general consensus that

8074
07:24:42 --> 07:24:43
<v MR. CARDIN>we needed to extend the

8075
07:24:43 --> 07:24:45
<v MR. CARDIN>unemployment insurance, that

8076
07:24:45 --> 07:24:47
<v MR. CARDIN>we're still in the recovery

8077
07:24:47 --> 07:24:50
<v MR. CARDIN>where unemployment rates are so

8078
07:24:50 --> 07:24:55
<v MR. CARDIN>high that it's important that we

8079
07:24:55 --> 07:24:57
<v MR. CARDIN>use this counter cyclical to

8080
07:24:57 --> 07:24:57
<v MR. CARDIN>help people but also build our

8081
07:24:57 --> 07:25:00
<v MR. CARDIN>economy.

8082
07:25:00 --> 07:25:01
<v MR. CARDIN>It helps create jobs, again,

8083
07:25:01 --> 07:25:03
<v MR. CARDIN>having more money available for

8084
07:25:03 --> 07:25:05
<v MR. CARDIN>the consumers to help our small

8085
07:25:05 --> 07:25:05
<v MR. CARDIN>businesses and to help our

8086
07:25:05 --> 07:25:08
<v MR. CARDIN>economy.

8087
07:25:08 --> 07:25:12
<v MR. CARDIN>And lastly, we all understood

8088
07:25:12 --> 07:25:15
<v MR. CARDIN>that we couldn't allow a 27% cut

8089
07:25:15 --> 07:25:16
<v MR. CARDIN>in medicare rates for

8090
07:25:16 --> 07:25:18
<v MR. CARDIN>physicians, that that would deny

8091
07:25:18 --> 07:25:18
<v MR. CARDIN>many of our seniors access to

8092
07:25:18 --> 07:25:21
<v MR. CARDIN>health care.

8093
07:25:21 --> 07:25:23
<v MR. CARDIN>So very early in the conference

8094
07:25:23 --> 07:25:24
<v MR. CARDIN>process we reached consensus

8095
07:25:24 --> 07:25:27
<v MR. CARDIN>that those three issues should

8096
07:25:27 --> 07:25:28
<v MR. CARDIN>be extended, at least through

8097
07:25:28 --> 07:25:31
<v MR. CARDIN>the end of this calendar year.

8098
07:25:31 --> 07:25:32
<v MR. CARDIN>I mean, for the payroll tax

8099
07:25:32 --> 07:25:33
<v MR. CARDIN>holiday, that was our

8100
07:25:33 --> 07:25:34
<v MR. CARDIN>understanding, to extend it

8101
07:25:34 --> 07:25:36
<v MR. CARDIN>through the end of the year.

8102
07:25:36 --> 07:25:39
<v MR. CARDIN>We know that the medicare issues

8103
07:25:39 --> 07:25:40
<v MR. CARDIN>really need to be extended for a

8104
07:25:40 --> 07:25:41
<v MR. CARDIN>longer period of time.

8105
07:25:41 --> 07:25:43
<v MR. CARDIN>We worked together, and I

8106
07:25:43 --> 07:25:46
<v MR. CARDIN>thought it was very important

8107
07:25:46 --> 07:25:47
<v MR. CARDIN>that we allow the full senate

8108
07:25:47 --> 07:25:48
<v MR. CARDIN>and the full house to consider

8109
07:25:48 --> 07:25:50
<v MR. CARDIN>that conference report.

8110
07:25:50 --> 07:25:52
<v MR. CARDIN>We've had too much gridlock.

8111
07:25:52 --> 07:25:55
<v MR. CARDIN>We've had too much individual

8112
07:25:55 --> 07:25:56
<v MR. CARDIN>members trying to phrobg the

8113
07:25:56 --> 07:25:57
<v MR. CARDIN>consideration -- trying to block

8114
07:25:57 --> 07:25:58
<v MR. CARDIN>the consideration of important

8115
07:25:58 --> 07:25:59
<v MR. CARDIN>legislation particularly in the

8116
07:25:59 --> 07:26:00
<v MR. CARDIN>united states senate.

8117
07:26:00 --> 07:26:02
<v MR. CARDIN>So I think it's very important

8118
07:26:02 --> 07:26:03
<v MR. CARDIN>that we were able to bring this

8119
07:26:03 --> 07:26:05
<v MR. CARDIN>issue to the full senate, and

8120
07:26:05 --> 07:26:06
<v MR. CARDIN>we're going to have, I hope, a

8121
07:26:06 --> 07:26:07
<v MR. CARDIN>good debate on this.

8122
07:26:07 --> 07:26:09
<v MR. CARDIN>And sometime tomorrow we're

8123
07:26:09 --> 07:26:10
<v MR. CARDIN>going to have a chance to vote

8124
07:26:10 --> 07:26:12
<v MR. CARDIN>on whether to accept the

8125
07:26:12 --> 07:26:14
<v MR. CARDIN>conference report or not.

8126
07:26:14 --> 07:26:16
<v MR. CARDIN>There's some good news, and I

8127
07:26:16 --> 07:26:19
<v MR. CARDIN>really do applaud again senator

8128
07:26:19 --> 07:26:23
<v MR. CARDIN>baucus and my colleagues,

8129
07:26:23 --> 07:26:26
<v MR. CARDIN>senator casey and.

8130
07:26:26 --> 07:26:26
<v MR. CARDIN>mr.

8131
07:26:26 --> 07:26:27
<v MR. CARDIN>Senator reed

8132
07:26:27 --> 07:26:28
<v MR. CARDIN>and the work done by the

8133
07:26:28 --> 07:26:30
<v MR. CARDIN>democrats on the committee.

8134
07:26:30 --> 07:26:33
<v MR. CARDIN>We took a very strong position

8135
07:26:33 --> 07:26:34
<v MR. CARDIN>against adding these extraneous

8136
07:26:34 --> 07:26:39
<v MR. CARDIN>provisions that came over from

8137
07:26:39 --> 07:26:40
<v MR. CARDIN>the house, the so-called boiler

8138
07:26:40 --> 07:26:41
<v MR. CARDIN>mact, a provision that would

8139
07:26:41 --> 07:26:42
<v MR. CARDIN>have affected the health of the

8140
07:26:42 --> 07:26:44
<v MR. CARDIN>people in our community.

8141
07:26:44 --> 07:26:45
<v MR. CARDIN>There is no question that if we

8142
07:26:45 --> 07:26:47
<v MR. CARDIN>had accepted the house position

8143
07:26:47 --> 07:26:52
<v MR. CARDIN>it would have weakened our clean

8144
07:26:52 --> 07:26:55
<v MR. CARDIN>air act, led to more premature

8145
07:26:55 --> 07:26:55
<v MR. CARDIN>deaths, more lost days from

8146
07:26:55 --> 07:26:58
<v MR. CARDIN>work.

8147
07:26:58 --> 07:27:00
<v MR. CARDIN>The cost-benefit ratio of this

8148
07:27:00 --> 07:27:02
<v MR. CARDIN>is well documented, that it will

8149
07:27:02 --> 07:27:04
<v MR. CARDIN>help our economy, help save the

8150
07:27:04 --> 07:27:07
<v MR. CARDIN>health and help save work days

8151
07:27:07 --> 07:27:08
<v MR. CARDIN>for american workers.

8152
07:27:08 --> 07:27:10
<v MR. CARDIN>We also removed a provision from

8153
07:27:10 --> 07:27:11
<v MR. CARDIN>the house bill that dealt with

8154
07:27:11 --> 07:27:14
<v MR. CARDIN>the keystone issue.

8155
07:27:14 --> 07:27:14
<v MR. CARDIN>This has to go through a regular

8156
07:27:14 --> 07:27:17
<v MR. CARDIN>regulatory process.

8157
07:27:17 --> 07:27:17
<v MR. CARDIN>It should have no place in this

8158
07:27:17 --> 07:27:20
<v MR. CARDIN>conference.

8159
07:27:20 --> 07:27:21
<v MR. CARDIN>We were able to remove that

8160
07:27:21 --> 07:27:23
<v MR. CARDIN>provision.

8161
07:27:23 --> 07:27:25
<v MR. CARDIN>On the unemployment insurance

8162
07:27:25 --> 07:27:31
<v MR. CARDIN>front, let me just mention that

8163
07:27:31 --> 07:27:32
<v MR. CARDIN>we were able to reserve the

8164
07:27:32 --> 07:27:33
<v MR. CARDIN>extension of unemployment

8165
07:27:33 --> 07:27:35
<v MR. CARDIN>insurance benefits.

8166
07:27:35 --> 07:27:37
<v MR. CARDIN>Under the current law, there's a

8167
07:27:37 --> 07:27:38
<v MR. CARDIN>maximum available of 99 weeks,

8168
07:27:38 --> 07:27:40
<v MR. CARDIN>but let me remind my colleagues

8169
07:27:40 --> 07:27:43
<v MR. CARDIN>that because of the way that the

8170
07:27:43 --> 07:27:45
<v MR. CARDIN>extended benefit program is

8171
07:27:45 --> 07:27:47
<v MR. CARDIN>calculated that at least in my

8172
07:27:47 --> 07:27:48
<v MR. CARDIN>state, by April those 20 weeks

8173
07:27:48 --> 07:27:50
<v MR. CARDIN>are likely to be not available

8174
07:27:50 --> 07:27:52
<v MR. CARDIN>for new people who become

8175
07:27:52 --> 07:27:53
<v MR. CARDIN>unemployed, and throughout the

8176
07:27:53 --> 07:27:55
<v MR. CARDIN>rest of our nation we're finding

8177
07:27:55 --> 07:27:57
<v MR. CARDIN>that the extended benefits

8178
07:27:57 --> 07:27:58
<v MR. CARDIN>programs will not be providing

8179
07:27:58 --> 07:27:59
<v MR. CARDIN>those extra weeks.

8180
07:27:59 --> 07:28:01
<v MR. CARDIN>What the conference committee

8181
07:28:01 --> 07:28:03
<v MR. CARDIN>recommendations are is to try to

8182
07:28:03 --> 07:28:04
<v MR. CARDIN>use better triggers as it

8183
07:28:04 --> 07:28:06
<v MR. CARDIN>relates to the different tiers

8184
07:28:06 --> 07:28:08
<v MR. CARDIN>of extended -- of benefits and

8185
07:28:08 --> 07:28:11
<v MR. CARDIN>the extended benefit program, so

8186
07:28:11 --> 07:28:12
<v MR. CARDIN>that the high unemployment

8187
07:28:13 --> 07:28:14
<v MR. CARDIN>states have a greater number of

8188
07:28:14 --> 07:28:16
<v MR. CARDIN>weeks than those states that are

8189
07:28:16 --> 07:28:19
<v MR. CARDIN>doing better, and to transition

8190
07:28:19 --> 07:28:20
<v MR. CARDIN>us to a more regular

8191
07:28:20 --> 07:28:22
<v MR. CARDIN>unemployment system as we go

8192
07:28:22 --> 07:28:25
<v MR. CARDIN>through the year.

8193
07:28:25 --> 07:28:28
<v MR. CARDIN>In regards to the medicare

8194
07:28:28 --> 07:28:33
<v MR. CARDIN>provisions in this bill, we were

8195
07:28:33 --> 07:28:35
<v MR. CARDIN>able not only to extend the

8196
07:28:35 --> 07:28:36
<v MR. CARDIN>sustainable growth rate, the

8197
07:28:36 --> 07:28:39
<v MR. CARDIN>S.G.R. System so we don't get

8198
07:28:39 --> 07:28:40
<v MR. CARDIN>the automatic cuts that would

8199
07:28:40 --> 07:28:42
<v MR. CARDIN>occur against physicians, we

8200
07:28:42 --> 07:28:44
<v MR. CARDIN>were able to extend that through

8201
07:28:44 --> 07:28:45
<v MR. CARDIN>the end of the year, but we also

8202
07:28:45 --> 07:28:47
<v MR. CARDIN>extended the therapy caps.

8203
07:28:47 --> 07:28:50
<v MR. CARDIN>if we didn't do that, those who

8204
07:28:50 --> 07:28:51
<v MR. CARDIN>are victims of stroke or hip

8205
07:28:51 --> 07:28:53
<v MR. CARDIN>replacement would have run into

8206
07:28:53 --> 07:28:54
<v MR. CARDIN>an arbitrary cap which would

8207
07:28:54 --> 07:28:56
<v MR. CARDIN>have denied them the therapy

8208
07:28:56 --> 07:28:58
<v MR. CARDIN>they need for their roeufrs.

8209
07:28:58 --> 07:28:59
<v MR. CARDIN>We were able -- recoveries.

8210
07:28:59 --> 07:29:01
<v MR. CARDIN>We were able to get that done.

8211
07:29:01 --> 07:29:02
<v MR. CARDIN>On the payroll tax, there was an

8212
07:29:02 --> 07:29:02
<v MR. CARDIN>agreement that we would extend

8213
07:29:02 --> 07:29:04
<v MR. CARDIN>that.

8214
07:29:04 --> 07:29:07
<v MR. CARDIN>The payroll tax is all about

8215
07:29:07 --> 07:29:10
<v MR. CARDIN>helping 160 million americans

8216
07:29:10 --> 07:29:11
<v MR. CARDIN>and it's about creating jobs.

8217
07:29:11 --> 07:29:12
<v MR. CARDIN>Okay.

8218
07:29:12 --> 07:29:13
<v MR. CARDIN>That's where we were able to

8219
07:29:13 --> 07:29:15
<v MR. CARDIN>come to an agreement that I

8220
07:29:15 --> 07:29:16
<v MR. CARDIN>think was in the best interest

8221
07:29:16 --> 07:29:18
<v MR. CARDIN>of the conference.

8222
07:29:18 --> 07:29:19
<v MR. CARDIN>Let me talk about some serious

8223
07:29:19 --> 07:29:20
<v MR. CARDIN>problems that I have with the

8224
07:29:21 --> 07:29:25
<v MR. CARDIN>conference report.

8225
07:29:25 --> 07:29:28
<v MR. CARDIN>And it deals with how we decided

8226
07:29:28 --> 07:29:29
<v MR. CARDIN>to fund or offset the cost of

8227
07:29:29 --> 07:29:30
<v MR. CARDIN>unemployment insurance

8228
07:29:30 --> 07:29:31
<v MR. CARDIN>extensions.

8229
07:29:31 --> 07:29:33
<v MR. CARDIN>Let me remind my colleagues,

8230
07:29:33 --> 07:29:35
<v MR. CARDIN>Mr. President, that this is a

8231
07:29:35 --> 07:29:36
<v MR. CARDIN>short-term extension where we're

8232
07:29:36 --> 07:29:38
<v MR. CARDIN>phasing out the extra benefits

8233
07:29:38 --> 07:29:40
<v MR. CARDIN>through the end of this year.

8234
07:29:40 --> 07:29:43
<v MR. CARDIN>It's calculated to cost about

8235
07:29:43 --> 07:29:45
<v MR. CARDIN>$30 billion.

8236
07:29:45 --> 07:29:47
<v MR. CARDIN>Historically we have extended

8237
07:29:47 --> 07:29:49
<v MR. CARDIN>unemployment insurance benefits

8238
07:29:49 --> 07:29:52
<v MR. CARDIN>during tough economic times

8239
07:29:52 --> 07:29:52
<v MR. CARDIN>without having offsets.

8240
07:29:52 --> 07:29:56
<v MR. CARDIN>Why?

8241
07:29:56 --> 07:29:58
<v MR. CARDIN>Because unemployment insurance

8242
07:29:58 --> 07:30:01
<v MR. CARDIN>is counter cyclical.

8243
07:30:01 --> 07:30:02
<v MR. CARDIN>It is there to help people

8244
07:30:02 --> 07:30:03
<v MR. CARDIN>during tough times.

8245
07:30:03 --> 07:30:04
<v MR. CARDIN>During good times we pay money

8246
07:30:04 --> 07:30:05
<v MR. CARDIN>into the system.

8247
07:30:05 --> 07:30:07
<v MR. CARDIN>We're trying to put more money

8248
07:30:07 --> 07:30:08
<v MR. CARDIN>into the economy.

8249
07:30:08 --> 07:30:09
<v MR. CARDIN>it doesn't make sense to take

8250
07:30:09 --> 07:30:10
<v MR. CARDIN>money out of the economy when

8251
07:30:10 --> 07:30:12
<v MR. CARDIN>we're trying to create jobs and

8252
07:30:12 --> 07:30:13
<v MR. CARDIN>getting our economy back on

8253
07:30:13 --> 07:30:14
<v MR. CARDIN>track.

8254
07:30:14 --> 07:30:17
<v MR. CARDIN>Unfortunately, that principle

8255
07:30:17 --> 07:30:18
<v MR. CARDIN>was violated in this conference

8256
07:30:18 --> 07:30:20
<v MR. CARDIN>report.

8257
07:30:20 --> 07:30:22
<v MR. CARDIN>The $30 billion is offset.

8258
07:30:22 --> 07:30:25
<v MR. CARDIN>Now let me just compare that to

8259
07:30:25 --> 07:30:27
<v MR. CARDIN>the payroll tax holiday, which

8260
07:30:27 --> 07:30:29
<v MR. CARDIN>is $100 billion, which many of

8261
07:30:29 --> 07:30:30
<v MR. CARDIN>us think should be offset, which

8262
07:30:30 --> 07:30:32
<v MR. CARDIN>is not offset.

8263
07:30:32 --> 07:30:35
<v MR. CARDIN>And as you know, Mr. President,

8264
07:30:35 --> 07:30:38
<v MR. CARDIN>we came in with recommendations

8265
07:30:38 --> 07:30:39
<v MR. CARDIN>where we could fairly offset the

8266
07:30:39 --> 07:30:41
<v MR. CARDIN>extension of the payroll tax

8267
07:30:41 --> 07:30:43
<v MR. CARDIN>holiday without adversely

8268
07:30:43 --> 07:30:45
<v MR. CARDIN>affecting our economy.

8269
07:30:45 --> 07:30:49
<v MR. CARDIN>We had suggested that for -- we

8270
07:30:49 --> 07:30:51
<v MR. CARDIN>would have a surtax on income

8271
07:30:51 --> 07:30:52
<v MR. CARDIN>exempting $1 million of taxable

8272
07:30:52 --> 07:30:54
<v MR. CARDIN>income from the surtax.

8273
07:30:54 --> 07:30:55
<v MR. CARDIN>A little bit of fairness in our

8274
07:30:55 --> 07:30:57
<v MR. CARDIN>tax code in order to make sure

8275
07:30:57 --> 07:30:59
<v MR. CARDIN>that we don't add to the

8276
07:30:59 --> 07:31:01
<v MR. CARDIN>deficit, don't hurt the economy,

8277
07:31:01 --> 07:31:02
<v MR. CARDIN>but allow middle-income

8278
07:31:02 --> 07:31:05
<v MR. CARDIN>taxpayers to continue to get

8279
07:31:05 --> 07:31:07
<v MR. CARDIN>their tax relief.

8280
07:31:07 --> 07:31:09
<v MR. CARDIN>To me, that would have been the

8281
07:31:09 --> 07:31:11
<v MR. CARDIN>responsible thing for us to do.

8282
07:31:11 --> 07:31:11
<v MR. CARDIN>But we didn't do that in this

8283
07:31:11 --> 07:31:14
<v MR. CARDIN>conference.

8284
07:31:14 --> 07:31:15
<v MR. CARDIN>Instead, we didn't pay for the

8285
07:31:15 --> 07:31:17
<v MR. CARDIN>$100 billion of extending the

8286
07:31:17 --> 07:31:19
<v MR. CARDIN>payroll tax but we pay for the

8287
07:31:19 --> 07:31:20
<v MR. CARDIN>unemployment insurance benefits

8288
07:31:20 --> 07:31:24
<v MR. CARDIN>$30 billion, which I would

8289
07:31:24 --> 07:31:25
<v MR. CARDIN>suggest to you we didn't have --

8290
07:31:25 --> 07:31:26
<v MR. CARDIN>that's an emergency.

8291
07:31:26 --> 07:31:28
<v MR. CARDIN>That truly is a matter that

8292
07:31:28 --> 07:31:28
<v MR. CARDIN>historically we have not paid

8293
07:31:28 --> 07:31:29
<v MR. CARDIN>for.

8294
07:31:29 --> 07:31:30
<v MR. CARDIN>All right.

8295
07:31:30 --> 07:31:32
<v MR. CARDIN>here's the problem.

8296
07:31:32 --> 07:31:33
<v MR. CARDIN>In order to pay for that

8297
07:31:33 --> 07:31:35
<v MR. CARDIN>$30 billion, we picked on our

8298
07:31:35 --> 07:31:38
<v MR. CARDIN>federal work force.

8299
07:31:38 --> 07:31:40
<v MR. CARDIN>I tell you, I find that wrong.

8300
07:31:40 --> 07:31:43
<v MR. CARDIN>We put a provision in this bill

8301
07:31:43 --> 07:31:45
<v MR. CARDIN>that will require new retirees,

8302
07:31:45 --> 07:31:47
<v MR. CARDIN>those who -- excuse me.

8303
07:31:47 --> 07:31:50
<v MR. CARDIN>New federal employees, those who

8304
07:31:50 --> 07:31:52
<v MR. CARDIN>start work after January of 2013

8305
07:31:52 --> 07:31:53
<v MR. CARDIN>to pay more for their defined

8306
07:31:53 --> 07:31:55
<v MR. CARDIN>benefit retirement benefits.

8307
07:31:55 --> 07:31:57
<v MR. CARDIN>That's how we funded about half

8308
07:31:57 --> 07:31:58
<v MR. CARDIN>the cost of extending the

8309
07:31:58 --> 07:31:59
<v MR. CARDIN>unemployment insurance.

8310
07:31:59 --> 07:32:02
<v MR. CARDIN>I think that's wrong.

8311
07:32:02 --> 07:32:05
<v MR. CARDIN>Let me just also say that the

8312
07:32:05 --> 07:32:07
<v MR. CARDIN>extension of the unemployment

8313
07:32:07 --> 07:32:09
<v MR. CARDIN>benefits is temporary.

8314
07:32:09 --> 07:32:13
<v MR. CARDIN>Only until the end of this year.

8315
07:32:13 --> 07:32:15
<v MR. CARDIN>the extra costs for the

8316
07:32:15 --> 07:32:15
<v MR. CARDIN>retirement benefits is

8317
07:32:15 --> 07:32:18
<v MR. CARDIN>permanent.

8318
07:32:18 --> 07:32:19
<v MR. CARDIN>It stays in the law.

8319
07:32:19 --> 07:32:21
<v MR. CARDIN>That doesn't seem like a good

8320
07:32:21 --> 07:32:21
<v MR. CARDIN>deal for what we are trying to

8321
07:32:21 --> 07:32:24
<v MR. CARDIN>do.

8322
07:32:24 --> 07:32:26
<v MR. CARDIN>We also are saying that one

8323
07:32:26 --> 07:32:28
<v MR. CARDIN>group of workers and only one

8324
07:32:28 --> 07:32:29
<v MR. CARDIN>group will make a contribution

8325
07:32:29 --> 07:32:30
<v MR. CARDIN>towards this.

8326
07:32:30 --> 07:32:32
<v MR. CARDIN>these are middle-class workers

8327
07:32:32 --> 07:32:35
<v MR. CARDIN>that are going to be paying for

8328
07:32:35 --> 07:32:37
<v MR. CARDIN>this -- a large part of the

8329
07:32:37 --> 07:32:39
<v MR. CARDIN>unemployment insurance costs.

8330
07:32:39 --> 07:32:40
<v MR. CARDIN>I just don't think that's right,

8331
07:32:40 --> 07:32:41
<v MR. CARDIN>I don't think we should have

8332
07:32:41 --> 07:32:43
<v MR. CARDIN>done that.

8333
07:32:43 --> 07:32:48
<v MR. CARDIN>Let me also point out as we talk

8334
07:32:48 --> 07:32:50
<v MR. CARDIN>about the federal work force

8335
07:32:50 --> 07:32:52
<v MR. CARDIN>that the additional costs that

8336
07:32:52 --> 07:32:55
<v MR. CARDIN>the new workers will pay will be

8337
07:32:55 --> 07:32:57
<v MR. CARDIN>2.3% of their payroll will go to

8338
07:32:57 --> 07:33:02
<v MR. CARDIN>a retirement trust fund that is

8339
07:33:02 --> 07:33:04
<v MR. CARDIN>already fully funded.

8340
07:33:04 --> 07:33:05
<v MR. CARDIN>So this is not to address a

8341
07:33:05 --> 07:33:07
<v MR. CARDIN>problem with the funding of the

8342
07:33:07 --> 07:33:07
<v MR. CARDIN>retirement plans for our federal

8343
07:33:07 --> 07:33:10
<v MR. CARDIN>employees.

8344
07:33:10 --> 07:33:12
<v MR. CARDIN>This is strictly, I think, a

8345
07:33:12 --> 07:33:13
<v MR. CARDIN>punitive hit at the federal work

8346
07:33:13 --> 07:33:15
<v MR. CARDIN>force.

8347
07:33:15 --> 07:33:16
<v MR. CARDIN>Public servants have already

8348
07:33:16 --> 07:33:19
<v MR. CARDIN>given $60 billion toward deficit

8349
07:33:19 --> 07:33:20
<v MR. CARDIN>reduction in the form of a

8350
07:33:20 --> 07:33:22
<v MR. CARDIN>two-year pay freeze and will

8351
07:33:22 --> 07:33:24
<v MR. CARDIN>give at least another

8352
07:33:24 --> 07:33:26
<v MR. CARDIN>$30 billion at the base pay

8353
07:33:26 --> 07:33:28
<v MR. CARDIN>adjustment for 2013 is.5%

8354
07:33:28 --> 07:33:30
<v MR. CARDIN>instead of the 1.2% which is

8355
07:33:30 --> 07:33:33
<v MR. CARDIN>what the adjustment should be

8356
07:33:33 --> 07:33:34
<v MR. CARDIN>under the federal employees' --

8357
07:33:34 --> 07:33:37
<v MR. CARDIN>pay comparability act.

8358
07:33:37 --> 07:33:39
<v MR. CARDIN>Add it all together and present

8359
07:33:39 --> 07:33:42
<v MR. CARDIN>and future federal workers are

8360
07:33:42 --> 07:33:46
<v MR. CARDIN>providing over $100 billion in

8361
07:33:46 --> 07:33:47
<v MR. CARDIN>deficit reduction, $100 billion

8362
07:33:47 --> 07:33:50
<v MR. CARDIN>in deficit reduction is coming

8363
07:33:50 --> 07:33:52
<v MR. CARDIN>out of our federal work force.

8364
07:33:52 --> 07:33:54
<v MR. CARDIN>yet, the republicans continue to

8365
07:33:54 --> 07:33:56
<v MR. CARDIN>defend the most affluent

8366
07:33:56 --> 07:33:59
<v MR. CARDIN>americans who won't pay one

8367
07:33:59 --> 07:34:00
<v MR. CARDIN>extra penny for funding this

8368
07:34:00 --> 07:34:02
<v MR. CARDIN>payroll tax package.

8369
07:34:02 --> 07:34:05
<v MR. CARDIN>I don't think that's right, I

8370
07:34:05 --> 07:34:06
<v MR. CARDIN>don't think that's fair, and I

8371
07:34:06 --> 07:34:07
<v MR. CARDIN>don't think we should have done

8372
07:34:07 --> 07:34:08
<v MR. CARDIN>it in that manner.

8373
07:34:08 --> 07:34:10
<v MR. CARDIN>Now, I want to say some things

8374
07:34:10 --> 07:34:11
<v MR. CARDIN>on a positive basis.

8375
07:34:11 --> 07:34:12
<v MR. CARDIN>You always look at things and

8376
07:34:12 --> 07:34:13
<v MR. CARDIN>say it could have been a lot

8377
07:34:13 --> 07:34:15
<v MR. CARDIN>worse, and that is true.

8378
07:34:15 --> 07:34:16
<v MR. CARDIN>It could have been a lot worse.

8379
07:34:16 --> 07:34:17
<v MR. CARDIN>When you look at the house bill

8380
07:34:17 --> 07:34:20
<v MR. CARDIN>that included these provisions,

8381
07:34:20 --> 07:34:21
<v MR. CARDIN>it included a pay freeze for our

8382
07:34:21 --> 07:34:23
<v MR. CARDIN>federal workers.

8383
07:34:23 --> 07:34:25
<v MR. CARDIN>That's not in this.

8384
07:34:25 --> 07:34:28
<v MR. CARDIN>We gut that out.

8385
07:34:28 --> 07:34:31
<v MR. CARDIN>I worked very hard with my

8386
07:34:31 --> 07:34:32
<v MR. CARDIN>colleague, congressman chris van

8387
07:34:32 --> 07:34:33
<v MR. CARDIN>hollins from maryland.

8388
07:34:33 --> 07:34:34
<v MR. CARDIN>we work together.

8389
07:34:34 --> 07:34:35
<v MR. CARDIN>In the original package, all

8390
07:34:35 --> 07:34:38
<v MR. CARDIN>federal workers would have had

8391
07:34:38 --> 07:34:39
<v MR. CARDIN>to pay more including current

8392
07:34:39 --> 07:34:40
<v MR. CARDIN>federal workers.

8393
07:34:40 --> 07:34:41
<v MR. CARDIN>This package does not affect

8394
07:34:41 --> 07:34:42
<v MR. CARDIN>current federal workers.

8395
07:34:42 --> 07:34:44
<v MR. CARDIN>They will not have to pay extra

8396
07:34:44 --> 07:34:45
<v MR. CARDIN>for their pension plans.

8397
07:34:45 --> 07:34:47
<v MR. CARDIN>That's fair.

8398
07:34:47 --> 07:34:48
<v MR. CARDIN>When they signed up as a federal

8399
07:34:48 --> 07:34:50
<v MR. CARDIN>employee, they knew what the

8400
07:34:50 --> 07:34:52
<v MR. CARDIN>ground rules were and they knew

8401
07:34:52 --> 07:34:54
<v MR. CARDIN>what the pension contributions

8402
07:34:54 --> 07:34:54
<v MR. CARDIN>would have to be, what the

8403
07:34:54 --> 07:34:57
<v MR. CARDIN>benefits were.

8404
07:34:57 --> 07:34:58
<v MR. CARDIN>It's right that we live up to

8405
07:34:58 --> 07:35:01
<v MR. CARDIN>that commitment.

8406
07:35:01 --> 07:35:03
<v MR. CARDIN>This agreement will not affect

8407
07:35:03 --> 07:35:05
<v MR. CARDIN>current workers, their pension

8408
07:35:05 --> 07:35:06
<v MR. CARDIN>contributions will remain the

8409
07:35:06 --> 07:35:08
<v MR. CARDIN>same.

8410
07:35:08 --> 07:35:11
<v MR. CARDIN>The bill that came over to us

8411
07:35:11 --> 07:35:11
<v MR. CARDIN>from the house also will reduce

8412
07:35:11 --> 07:35:13
<v MR. CARDIN>pension benefits.

8413
07:35:13 --> 07:35:14
<v MR. CARDIN>we took that out of the bill.

8414
07:35:14 --> 07:35:15
<v MR. CARDIN>That's not in the bill.

8415
07:35:15 --> 07:35:18
<v MR. CARDIN>And the rate that they would

8416
07:35:18 --> 07:35:20
<v MR. CARDIN>have had new hires pay is higher

8417
07:35:20 --> 07:35:22
<v MR. CARDIN>than what we agreed to in this

8418
07:35:22 --> 07:35:27
<v MR. CARDIN>package.

8419
07:35:27 --> 07:35:28
<v MR. CARDIN>So congressman van hollen and

8420
07:35:28 --> 07:35:31
<v MR. CARDIN>myself worked very hard to try

8421
07:35:31 --> 07:35:32
<v MR. CARDIN>to accommodate the parameters of

8422
07:35:32 --> 07:35:33
<v MR. CARDIN>the conference with what was

8423
07:35:33 --> 07:35:35
<v MR. CARDIN>being required of our federal

8424
07:35:35 --> 07:35:36
<v MR. CARDIN>work force in a way that would

8425
07:35:36 --> 07:35:37
<v MR. CARDIN>not penalize our existing

8426
07:35:37 --> 07:35:39
<v MR. CARDIN>workers and would not be

8427
07:35:39 --> 07:35:42
<v MR. CARDIN>anywhere near as punitive as the

8428
07:35:42 --> 07:35:43
<v MR. CARDIN>provisions that were put in the

8429
07:35:43 --> 07:35:47
<v MR. CARDIN>house bill.

8430
07:35:47 --> 07:35:48
<v MR. CARDIN>So we're at least grateful that

8431
07:35:48 --> 07:35:52
<v MR. CARDIN>the conference includes that but

8432
07:35:52 --> 07:35:53
<v MR. CARDIN>I can't help but be disappointed

8433
07:35:53 --> 07:35:55
<v MR. CARDIN>that the unemployment insurance

8434
07:35:55 --> 07:35:57
<v MR. CARDIN>is being financed at least in

8435
07:35:57 --> 07:36:01
<v MR. CARDIN>half by a permanent change in

8436
07:36:01 --> 07:36:03
<v MR. CARDIN>the contribution rates to define

8437
07:36:03 --> 07:36:06
<v MR. CARDIN>benefit plans by those who join

8438
07:36:06 --> 07:36:07
<v MR. CARDIN>the federal work force after

8439
07:36:07 --> 07:36:09
<v MR. CARDIN>January 1, 2013.

8440
07:36:09 --> 07:36:15
<v MR. CARDIN>They are the only ones who are

8441
07:36:15 --> 07:36:16
<v MR. CARDIN>affected by that proposal.

8442
07:36:16 --> 07:36:18
<v MR. CARDIN>Mr. President, let me just

8443
07:36:18 --> 07:36:24
<v MR. CARDIN>conclude by saying that we all

8444
07:36:24 --> 07:36:25
<v MR. CARDIN>should be pleased that the

8445
07:36:25 --> 07:36:26
<v MR. CARDIN>crrches worked, that we took a

8446
07:36:26 --> 07:36:28
<v MR. CARDIN>difficult issue in which there

8447
07:36:28 --> 07:36:33
<v MR. CARDIN>are strong fundamental

8448
07:36:33 --> 07:36:34
<v MR. CARDIN>differences between the house

8449
07:36:34 --> 07:36:36
<v MR. CARDIN>and the senate and we were able

8450
07:36:36 --> 07:36:37
<v MR. CARDIN>to come to an agreement to at

8451
07:36:37 --> 07:36:39
<v MR. CARDIN>least be presented to the

8452
07:36:39 --> 07:36:41
<v MR. CARDIN>members of the house and senate

8453
07:36:41 --> 07:36:45
<v MR. CARDIN>for an up-or-down vote where

8454
07:36:45 --> 07:36:46
<v MR. CARDIN>each one of us can make our own

8455
07:36:46 --> 07:36:47
<v MR. CARDIN>judgments as to whether we think

8456
07:36:47 --> 07:36:49
<v MR. CARDIN>this is the right package for

8457
07:36:49 --> 07:36:51
<v MR. CARDIN>the american people or night.

8458
07:36:51 --> 07:36:52
<v MR. CARDIN>I might have a different view

8459
07:36:52 --> 07:36:54
<v MR. CARDIN>than the presiding officer.

8460
07:36:54 --> 07:36:55
<v MR. CARDIN>We'll be able to express our

8461
07:36:55 --> 07:36:56
<v MR. CARDIN>views by our votes tomorrow.

8462
07:36:56 --> 07:36:58
<v MR. CARDIN>I would hope that that process

8463
07:36:58 --> 07:37:01
<v MR. CARDIN>would be used so that we can get

8464
07:37:01 --> 07:37:01
<v MR. CARDIN>more work done for the american

8465
07:37:01 --> 07:37:04
<v MR. CARDIN>people.

8466
07:37:04 --> 07:37:05
<v MR. CARDIN>They want us to work together.

8467
07:37:05 --> 07:37:07
<v MR. CARDIN>They want democrats and

8468
07:37:07 --> 07:37:08
<v MR. CARDIN>republicans to say okay, we know

8469
07:37:08 --> 07:37:11
<v MR. CARDIN>that you differ on issues.

8470
07:37:11 --> 07:37:11
<v MR. CARDIN>Now get together and get things

8471
07:37:11 --> 07:37:13
<v MR. CARDIN>done.

8472
07:37:13 --> 07:37:15
<v MR. CARDIN>We have a transportation bill

8473
07:37:15 --> 07:37:17
<v MR. CARDIN>that's on the floor that we're

8474
07:37:17 --> 07:37:19
<v MR. CARDIN>talking about today.

8475
07:37:19 --> 07:37:20
<v MR. CARDIN>That transportation bill should

8476
07:37:20 --> 07:37:21
<v MR. CARDIN>end up on the President's desks.

8477
07:37:21 --> 07:37:25
<v MR. CARDIN>That transportation bill came

8478
07:37:25 --> 07:37:26
<v MR. CARDIN>out of our committees by

8479
07:37:26 --> 07:37:28
<v MR. CARDIN>bipartisan votes.

8480
07:37:28 --> 07:37:31
<v MR. CARDIN>So now let's not clutter that

8481
07:37:31 --> 07:37:32
<v MR. CARDIN>bill up with issues that will

8482
07:37:32 --> 07:37:34
<v MR. CARDIN>divide us.

8483
07:37:34 --> 07:37:35
<v MR. CARDIN>let's work in the spirit that

8484
07:37:35 --> 07:37:37
<v MR. CARDIN>the conference committee that I

8485
07:37:37 --> 07:37:39
<v MR. CARDIN>was privileged to serve on

8486
07:37:39 --> 07:37:41
<v MR. CARDIN>worked on and try to keep it

8487
07:37:41 --> 07:37:45
<v MR. CARDIN>relevant to the issues at hand

8488
07:37:45 --> 07:37:46
<v MR. CARDIN>so that at the end of the day we

8489
07:37:46 --> 07:37:47
<v MR. CARDIN>can not only pass the

8490
07:37:47 --> 07:37:48
<v MR. CARDIN>transportation bill in the

8491
07:37:48 --> 07:37:50
<v MR. CARDIN>united states senate, we can get

8492
07:37:50 --> 07:37:51
<v MR. CARDIN>it passed in the house of

8493
07:37:51 --> 07:37:53
<v MR. CARDIN>representatives or work out our

8494
07:37:53 --> 07:37:54
<v MR. CARDIN>differences and get it to the

8495
07:37:54 --> 07:37:55
<v MR. CARDIN>President For signature.

8496
07:37:55 --> 07:37:56
<v MR. CARDIN>that will create jobs, and by

8497
07:37:56 --> 07:38:00
<v MR. CARDIN>the way I think the american

8498
07:38:00 --> 07:38:02
<v MR. CARDIN>people will applaud us for

8499
07:38:02 --> 07:38:03
<v MR. CARDIN>really moving forward with the

8500
07:38:03 --> 07:38:05
<v MR. CARDIN>people's business.

8501
07:38:05 --> 07:38:06
<v MR. CARDIN>That's what we need to do.

8502
07:38:06 --> 07:38:08
<v MR. CARDIN>Mr. President, if we can get

8503
07:38:08 --> 07:38:10
<v MR. CARDIN>that bill done, maybe and just

8504
07:38:10 --> 07:38:10
<v MR. CARDIN>maybe we can get other issues

8505
07:38:10 --> 07:38:12
<v MR. CARDIN>done.

8506
07:38:12 --> 07:38:14
<v MR. CARDIN>I have talked to my republican

8507
07:38:14 --> 07:38:16
<v MR. CARDIN>colleagues and they all agree

8508
07:38:16 --> 07:38:17
<v MR. CARDIN>that we can't allow

8509
07:38:17 --> 07:38:19
<v MR. CARDIN>sequestration to take place,

8510
07:38:19 --> 07:38:20
<v MR. CARDIN>that's these automatic cuts, if

8511
07:38:20 --> 07:38:21
<v MR. CARDIN>we can't do another

8512
07:38:21 --> 07:38:22
<v MR. CARDIN>$1.2 trillion of deficit

8513
07:38:22 --> 07:38:23
<v MR. CARDIN>reduction over the next ten

8514
07:38:23 --> 07:38:25
<v MR. CARDIN>years.

8515
07:38:25 --> 07:38:25
<v MR. CARDIN>We should be able to get that

8516
07:38:25 --> 07:38:27
<v MR. CARDIN>done.

8517
07:38:27 --> 07:38:30
<v MR. CARDIN>We shouldn't have to wait until

8518
07:38:30 --> 07:38:33
<v MR. CARDIN>after the November elections.

8519
07:38:33 --> 07:38:34
<v MR. CARDIN>Let's take a lesson from how the

8520
07:38:34 --> 07:38:36
<v MR. CARDIN>conference committee that i

8521
07:38:36 --> 07:38:38
<v MR. CARDIN>served on work.

8522
07:38:38 --> 07:38:40
<v MR. CARDIN>Let's sit down and work out our

8523
07:38:40 --> 07:38:42
<v MR. CARDIN>differences and not try to say

8524
07:38:42 --> 07:38:43
<v MR. CARDIN>it's got to be my way or I'm not

8525
07:38:43 --> 07:38:45
<v MR. CARDIN>going to get it done.

8526
07:38:45 --> 07:38:47
<v MR. CARDIN>That's what's in the best

8527
07:38:47 --> 07:38:48
<v MR. CARDIN>interests of the united states

8528
07:38:48 --> 07:38:50
<v MR. CARDIN>senate and that's in the best

8529
07:38:50 --> 07:38:53
<v MR. CARDIN>interests of our nation.

8530
07:38:53 --> 07:38:55
<v MR. CARDIN>So I hope that we will have a

8531
07:38:55 --> 07:38:56
<v MR. CARDIN>robust debate on the conference

8532
07:38:56 --> 07:38:57
<v MR. CARDIN>report.

8533
07:38:57 --> 07:38:59
<v MR. CARDIN>I hope each member will have an

8534
07:38:59 --> 07:39:01
<v MR. CARDIN>opportunity to review it, and at

8535
07:39:01 --> 07:39:02
<v MR. CARDIN>the end of the day, the majority

8536
07:39:02 --> 07:39:06
<v MR. CARDIN>should -- we will have a chance

8537
07:39:06 --> 07:39:08
<v MR. CARDIN>to see how the votes which.

8538
07:39:08 --> 07:39:09
<v MR. CARDIN>Again, I'm sorry that I have

8539
07:39:09 --> 07:39:11
<v MR. CARDIN>certain reservations about it

8540
07:39:11 --> 07:39:12
<v MR. CARDIN>that I needed to express, but

8541
07:39:12 --> 07:39:14
<v MR. CARDIN>quite frankly I think we need to

8542
07:39:14 --> 07:39:15
<v MR. CARDIN>stand up for our federal work

8543
07:39:15 --> 07:39:17
<v MR. CARDIN>force who are out there every

8544
07:39:17 --> 07:39:18
<v MR. CARDIN>day providing services to our

8545
07:39:18 --> 07:39:20
<v MR. CARDIN>people, whether it's guarding

8546
07:39:20 --> 07:39:23
<v MR. CARDIN>our borders, whether it's

8547
07:39:23 --> 07:39:24
<v MR. CARDIN>finding the answers to the

8548
07:39:24 --> 07:39:26
<v MR. CARDIN>diseases, whether it's helping

8549
07:39:26 --> 07:39:27
<v MR. CARDIN>us develop the technology that

8550
07:39:27 --> 07:39:29
<v MR. CARDIN>will make america competitive,

8551
07:39:29 --> 07:39:31
<v MR. CARDIN>whether it's providing public

8552
07:39:31 --> 07:39:32
<v MR. CARDIN>safety as a correctional

8553
07:39:32 --> 07:39:34
<v MR. CARDIN>officer, whether it's helping us

8554
07:39:34 --> 07:39:35
<v MR. CARDIN>make sure we get our social

8555
07:39:35 --> 07:39:36
<v MR. CARDIN>security checks or get our

8556
07:39:36 --> 07:39:37
<v MR. CARDIN>disability checks.

8557
07:39:37 --> 07:39:38
<v MR. CARDIN>these are people that are on the

8558
07:39:38 --> 07:39:40
<v MR. CARDIN>front line that we're asking to

8559
07:39:40 --> 07:39:42
<v MR. CARDIN>do more with less, and they

8560
07:39:42 --> 07:39:43
<v MR. CARDIN>deserve not just the respect of

8561
07:39:43 --> 07:39:43
<v MR. CARDIN>this body but they deserve our

8562
07:39:44 --> 07:39:45
<v MR. CARDIN>support.

8563
07:39:45 --> 07:39:46
<v MR. CARDIN>With that, Mr. President, I

8564
07:39:46 --> 07:39:47
<v MR. CARDIN>would suggest the absence of a

8565
07:39:47 --> 07:39:48
<v MR. CARDIN>quorum.

8566
07:39:48 --> 07:39:50
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the clerk

8567
07:39:50 --> 07:39:51
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>will call the roll.

8568
07:47:34 --> 07:47:35
<v MR. INHOFE>Mr. President.

8569
07:47:35 --> 07:47:37
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

8570
07:47:37 --> 07:47:38
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senator from oklahoma.

8571
07:47:37 --> 07:47:38
<v MR. INHOFE>I ask unanimous

8572
07:47:38 --> 07:47:39
<v MR. INHOFE>consent the quorum call in

8573
07:47:39 --> 07:47:40
<v MR. INHOFE>progress be vitiated.

8574
07:47:40 --> 07:47:41
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

8575
07:47:41 --> 07:47:42
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

8576
07:47:42 --> 07:47:44
<v MR. INHOFE>I ask unanimous

8577
07:47:44 --> 07:47:44
<v MR. INHOFE>consent I be recognized as if in

8578
07:47:44 --> 07:47:45
<v MR. INHOFE>morning business.

8579
07:47:45 --> 07:47:46
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

8580
07:47:46 --> 07:47:47
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

8581
07:47:47 --> 07:47:48
<v MR. INHOFE>thank you,

8582
07:47:48 --> 07:47:51
<v MR. INHOFE>Mr. President.

8583
07:47:51 --> 07:47:54
<v MR. INHOFE>I want to announce that I

8584
07:47:54 --> 07:47:56
<v MR. INHOFE>introduced a resolution of

8585
07:47:56 --> 07:47:57
<v MR. INHOFE>disapproval today just a few

8586
07:47:57 --> 07:47:58
<v MR. INHOFE>minutes ago under the

8587
07:47:58 --> 07:47:59
<v MR. INHOFE>congressional review act.

8588
07:47:59 --> 07:48:01
<v MR. INHOFE>A lot of people don't know what

8589
07:48:01 --> 07:48:03
<v MR. INHOFE>the congressional review act

8590
07:48:03 --> 07:48:04
<v MR. INHOFE>is, but it's an act that will

8591
07:48:04 --> 07:48:06
<v MR. INHOFE>allow congress to look at some

8592
07:48:06 --> 07:48:06
<v MR. INHOFE>of the regulations and if

8593
07:48:06 --> 07:48:08
<v MR. INHOFE>there's something they don't

8594
07:48:08 --> 07:48:10
<v MR. INHOFE>feel is in the best interests of

8595
07:48:10 --> 07:48:12
<v MR. INHOFE>the country are able to

8596
07:48:12 --> 07:48:12
<v MR. INHOFE>introduce something to rescind

8597
07:48:12 --> 07:48:13
<v MR. INHOFE>that.

8598
07:48:13 --> 07:48:18
<v MR. INHOFE>And it would call for a vote and

8599
07:48:18 --> 07:48:20
<v MR. INHOFE>the vote would be a 51 vote,

8600
07:48:20 --> 07:48:22
<v MR. INHOFE>and so it's one that has not

8601
07:48:22 --> 07:48:24
<v MR. INHOFE>been used very much, but it's a

8602
07:48:24 --> 07:48:27
<v MR. INHOFE>measure that would prevent in

8603
07:48:27 --> 07:48:31
<v MR. INHOFE>this case the obama E.P.A. From

8604
07:48:31 --> 07:48:33
<v MR. INHOFE>going through with its utility

8605
07:48:33 --> 07:48:36
<v MR. INHOFE>mact rule.

8606
07:48:36 --> 07:48:39
<v MR. INHOFE>Mact is the maximum achievable

8607
07:48:39 --> 07:48:40
<v MR. INHOFE>control technology and that used

8608
07:48:40 --> 07:48:41
<v MR. INHOFE>quite often because there are

8609
07:48:41 --> 07:48:43
<v MR. INHOFE>sometimes requirements in these

8610
07:48:43 --> 07:48:44
<v MR. INHOFE>E.P.A. Rules that require

8611
07:48:44 --> 07:48:47
<v MR. INHOFE>different industries to do

8612
07:48:47 --> 07:48:48
<v MR. INHOFE>things where there is no

8613
07:48:48 --> 07:48:50
<v MR. INHOFE>technology available to allow

8614
07:48:50 --> 07:48:53
<v MR. INHOFE>them to get that done.

8615
07:48:53 --> 07:48:54
<v MR. INHOFE>So the utility mact is one of

8616
07:48:54 --> 07:48:55
<v MR. INHOFE>the most expensive environmental

8617
07:48:55 --> 07:48:58
<v MR. INHOFE>rules in american history,

8618
07:48:58 --> 07:49:00
<v MR. INHOFE>second only to President Obama's

8619
07:49:00 --> 07:49:02
<v MR. INHOFE>cap-and-trade rules which he was

8620
07:49:02 --> 07:49:04
<v MR. INHOFE>unable to achieve legislatively

8621
07:49:04 --> 07:49:06
<v MR. INHOFE>and left untouched, the utility

8622
07:49:06 --> 07:49:08
<v MR. INHOFE>mact would destroy over a

8623
07:49:08 --> 07:49:09
<v MR. INHOFE>million jobs and cost the

8624
07:49:09 --> 07:49:10
<v MR. INHOFE>american economy billions of

8625
07:49:10 --> 07:49:14
<v MR. INHOFE>dollars.

8626
07:49:14 --> 07:49:16
<v MR. INHOFE>Now, my C.R.A. That's getting

8627
07:49:16 --> 07:49:17
<v MR. INHOFE>congressional review act, would

8628
07:49:17 --> 07:49:19
<v MR. INHOFE>be a moment of truth for the

8629
07:49:19 --> 07:49:23
<v MR. INHOFE>majority of this body who

8630
07:49:23 --> 07:49:24
<v MR. INHOFE>understand how harmful the obama

8631
07:49:24 --> 07:49:25
<v MR. INHOFE>E.P.A. Regulatory agenda will be

8632
07:49:25 --> 07:49:28
<v MR. INHOFE>for their constituents.

8633
07:49:28 --> 07:49:29
<v MR. INHOFE>You remember last year at this

8634
07:49:29 --> 07:49:32
<v MR. INHOFE>time, 64 senators voted in

8635
07:49:32 --> 07:49:34
<v MR. INHOFE>different ways to rein in the

8636
07:49:34 --> 07:49:35
<v MR. INHOFE>E.P.A.'s destructive greenhouse

8637
07:49:35 --> 07:49:37
<v MR. INHOFE>gas regulations.

8638
07:49:37 --> 07:49:39
<v MR. INHOFE>And some of them actually, I

8639
07:49:39 --> 07:49:42
<v MR. INHOFE>had my bill out to do this, to

8640
07:49:42 --> 07:49:44
<v MR. INHOFE>take away the jurisdiction from

8641
07:49:44 --> 07:49:48
<v MR. INHOFE>the environmental protection

8642
07:49:48 --> 07:49:50
<v MR. INHOFE>agency, to rule -- to regulate

8643
07:49:50 --> 07:49:51
<v MR. INHOFE>greenhouse gases.

8644
07:49:51 --> 07:49:54
<v MR. INHOFE>It was called the energy tax

8645
07:49:54 --> 07:49:56
<v MR. INHOFE>prevention act.

8646
07:49:56 --> 07:49:57
<v MR. INHOFE>Now, at the same time I call a

8647
07:49:57 --> 07:49:59
<v MR. INHOFE>cover -- there was another

8648
07:49:59 --> 07:50:00
<v MR. INHOFE>one, I call a cover vote,

8649
07:50:00 --> 07:50:01
<v MR. INHOFE>sometimes when you want to tell

8650
07:50:01 --> 07:50:04
<v MR. INHOFE>people at home you're against

8651
07:50:04 --> 07:50:06
<v MR. INHOFE>something, scruff a less

8652
07:50:06 --> 07:50:07
<v MR. INHOFE>maybe -- you can have a less

8653
07:50:07 --> 07:50:09
<v MR. INHOFE>maybe severe vote and there is a

8654
07:50:09 --> 07:50:11
<v MR. INHOFE>cover vote that takes place.

8655
07:50:11 --> 07:50:13
<v MR. INHOFE>The bottom line here is 64 of

8656
07:50:13 --> 07:50:15
<v MR. INHOFE>the 100 senators voted to do

8657
07:50:15 --> 07:50:16
<v MR. INHOFE>something about the

8658
07:50:16 --> 07:50:19
<v MR. INHOFE>overregulation that's coming out

8659
07:50:19 --> 07:50:20
<v MR. INHOFE>of the environmental protection

8660
07:50:20 --> 07:50:23
<v MR. INHOFE>agencies.

8661
07:50:23 --> 07:50:25
<v MR. INHOFE>and that particular one was on

8662
07:50:25 --> 07:50:28
<v MR. INHOFE>the -- the regular that would

8663
07:50:28 --> 07:50:31
<v MR. INHOFE>be the most expensive at all.

8664
07:50:31 --> 07:50:33
<v MR. INHOFE>The utility mact that I'm

8665
07:50:33 --> 07:50:34
<v MR. INHOFE>offering the C.R.A. On now is

8666
07:50:34 --> 07:50:35
<v MR. INHOFE>probably the second most

8667
07:50:35 --> 07:50:37
<v MR. INHOFE>expensive.

8668
07:50:37 --> 07:50:39
<v MR. INHOFE>But to refresh your memory on

8669
07:50:39 --> 07:50:41
<v MR. INHOFE>this, in order to have the

8670
07:50:41 --> 07:50:43
<v MR. INHOFE>e.P.A. Have jurisdiction over

8671
07:50:43 --> 07:50:44
<v MR. INHOFE>the regulation of greenhouse

8672
07:50:44 --> 07:50:47
<v MR. INHOFE>gases, they have to somehow

8673
07:50:47 --> 07:50:47
<v MR. INHOFE>come up with an endangerment

8674
07:50:47 --> 07:50:49
<v MR. INHOFE>finding.

8675
07:50:49 --> 07:50:54
<v MR. INHOFE>They did and they based it on

8676
07:50:54 --> 07:50:57
<v MR. INHOFE>science, the the ipcc science

8677
07:50:57 --> 07:51:00
<v MR. INHOFE>that was -- that gave to --

8678
07:51:00 --> 07:51:01
<v MR. INHOFE>rise to the concern that was

8679
07:51:01 --> 07:51:04
<v MR. INHOFE>exposed in climategate.

8680
07:51:04 --> 07:51:05
<v MR. INHOFE>And so I think everyone unders

8681
07:51:05 --> 07:51:08
<v MR. INHOFE>that was flawed science.

8682
07:51:08 --> 07:51:09
<v MR. INHOFE>But nonetheless that's what they

8683
07:51:09 --> 07:51:12
<v MR. INHOFE>used and that's why we were able

8684
07:51:12 --> 07:51:14
<v MR. INHOFE>to get two-thirds of this body

8685
07:51:14 --> 07:51:16
<v MR. INHOFE>objecting to the E.P.A.

8686
07:51:16 --> 07:51:17
<v MR. INHOFE>Regulating greenhouse gases.

8687
07:51:17 --> 07:51:20
<v MR. INHOFE>Well, I think that the bottom

8688
07:51:20 --> 07:51:23
<v MR. INHOFE>line now is that there are more

8689
07:51:23 --> 07:51:24
<v MR. INHOFE>than a dozen state -- senate

8690
07:51:24 --> 07:51:26
<v MR. INHOFE>democrats have claimed they want

8691
07:51:26 --> 07:51:28
<v MR. INHOFE>to rein in the E.P.A. Because

8692
07:51:28 --> 07:51:30
<v MR. INHOFE>they know the devastating impact

8693
07:51:30 --> 07:51:31
<v MR. INHOFE>the agriculture's regulatory

8694
07:51:31 --> 07:51:33
<v MR. INHOFE>train wreck will have at home.

8695
07:51:33 --> 07:51:34
<v MR. INHOFE>The senators understand if their

8696
07:51:34 --> 07:51:36
<v MR. INHOFE>constituents lose their jobs,

8697
07:51:36 --> 07:51:37
<v MR. INHOFE>as a result of these

8698
07:51:37 --> 07:51:40
<v MR. INHOFE>overregulations, they might

8699
07:51:40 --> 07:51:43
<v MR. INHOFE>lose their job.

8700
07:51:43 --> 07:51:44
<v MR. INHOFE>so anyway, the -- today the

8701
07:51:44 --> 07:51:45
<v MR. INHOFE>united states senate can look

8702
07:51:45 --> 07:51:48
<v MR. INHOFE>forward to having one more

8703
07:51:48 --> 07:51:49
<v MR. INHOFE>opportunity to stand up to

8704
07:51:49 --> 07:51:50
<v MR. INHOFE>President Obama's war on

8705
07:51:50 --> 07:51:52
<v MR. INHOFE>affordable energy.

8706
07:51:52 --> 07:51:55
<v MR. INHOFE>They can vote for this C.R.A.

8707
07:51:55 --> 07:51:59
<v MR. INHOFE>Which would -- will put -- put

8708
07:51:59 --> 07:52:01
<v MR. INHOFE>a halt to one of the obama

8709
07:52:01 --> 07:52:04
<v MR. INHOFE>E.P.A.'s expensive and

8710
07:52:04 --> 07:52:07
<v MR. INHOFE>economically destructive rules.

8711
07:52:07 --> 07:52:08
<v MR. INHOFE>Under the utility mact, it

8712
07:52:08 --> 07:52:10
<v MR. INHOFE>would -- it would cost american

8713
07:52:10 --> 07:52:12
<v MR. INHOFE>families, the analysis -- and

8714
07:52:12 --> 07:52:14
<v MR. INHOFE>nobody really disgrease with

8715
07:52:14 --> 07:52:16
<v MR. INHOFE>this -- the range is between

8716
07:52:16 --> 07:52:25
<v MR. INHOFE>$11 billion and $18 billion in

8717
07:52:25 --> 07:52:28
<v MR. INHOFE>electricity rate increases.

8718
07:52:28 --> 07:52:30
<v MR. INHOFE>If we pass this utility mact,

8719
07:52:30 --> 07:52:31
<v MR. INHOFE>under the regulations of the

8720
07:52:31 --> 07:52:32
<v MR. INHOFE>utilities.

8721
07:52:32 --> 07:52:36
<v MR. INHOFE>This would send ripple effects

8722
07:52:36 --> 07:52:37
<v MR. INHOFE>throughout the economy causing

8723
07:52:37 --> 07:52:42
<v MR. INHOFE>approximately 1.4 million net

8724
07:52:42 --> 07:52:44
<v MR. INHOFE>job -- job losses by 2020.

8725
07:52:44 --> 07:52:46
<v MR. INHOFE>not just jobs in the coal

8726
07:52:46 --> 07:52:48
<v MR. INHOFE>industry that would be affected.

8727
07:52:48 --> 07:52:50
<v MR. INHOFE>Dr. Bernard winestein of the

8728
07:52:50 --> 07:52:52
<v MR. INHOFE>maguire institute of southern

8729
07:52:52 --> 07:52:54
<v MR. INHOFE>methodist university has

8730
07:52:54 --> 07:52:56
<v MR. INHOFE>estimated E.P.A.'s rules could

8731
07:52:56 --> 07:52:58
<v MR. INHOFE>endanger a million manufacturing

8732
07:52:58 --> 07:53:00
<v MR. INHOFE>jobs outside of the coal and

8733
07:53:00 --> 07:53:02
<v MR. INHOFE>utility industry losses.

8734
07:53:02 --> 07:53:04
<v MR. INHOFE>Workers recently laid off in

8735
07:53:04 --> 07:53:06
<v MR. INHOFE>ohio, kentucky, and west

8736
07:53:06 --> 07:53:07
<v MR. INHOFE>virginia are feeling the

8737
07:53:07 --> 07:53:09
<v MR. INHOFE>devastating impacts of the

8738
07:53:09 --> 07:53:12
<v MR. INHOFE>rule, and sadly, these lost

8739
07:53:12 --> 07:53:15
<v MR. INHOFE>jobs are all part of obama's

8740
07:53:15 --> 07:53:15
<v MR. INHOFE>wider war on coal and fossil

8741
07:53:15 --> 07:53:17
<v MR. INHOFE>fuels.

8742
07:53:17 --> 07:53:19
<v MR. INHOFE>You might remember that he

8743
07:53:19 --> 07:53:21
<v MR. INHOFE>admitted this in -- this was

8744
07:53:21 --> 07:53:23
<v MR. INHOFE>his goal in the campaign of 2008

8745
07:53:23 --> 07:53:25
<v MR. INHOFE>when he said, this is a quote,

8746
07:53:25 --> 07:53:27
<v MR. INHOFE>he said &quot;if somebody wants to

8747
07:53:27 --> 07:53:28
<v MR. INHOFE>build a coal fired plant, they

8748
07:53:28 --> 07:53:31
<v MR. INHOFE>can do it.

8749
07:53:31 --> 07:53:31
<v MR. INHOFE>It's just that it will bankrupt

8750
07:53:31 --> 07:53:33
<v MR. INHOFE>them.

8751
07:53:33 --> 07:53:33
<v MR. INHOFE>And this is quoting President

8752
07:53:33 --> 07:53:35
<v MR. INHOFE>Obama.

8753
07:53:35 --> 07:53:38
<v MR. INHOFE>Under my plan of capital and

8754
07:53:38 --> 07:53:39
<v MR. INHOFE>trade system -- cap-and-trade

8755
07:53:39 --> 07:53:42
<v MR. INHOFE>system, electricity rates would

8756
07:53:42 --> 07:53:46
<v MR. INHOFE>necessarily skyrocket, unquote.

8757
07:53:46 --> 07:53:47
<v MR. INHOFE>when the cap-and-trade failed,

8758
07:53:47 --> 07:53:50
<v MR. INHOFE>obama began aggressively

8759
07:53:50 --> 07:53:51
<v MR. INHOFE>pursuing these goals through an

8760
07:53:51 --> 07:53:52
<v MR. INHOFE>executive regulatory barrage of

8761
07:53:52 --> 07:53:55
<v MR. INHOFE>unelected bureaucrats.

8762
07:53:55 --> 07:53:57
<v MR. INHOFE>So companies like solyndra got

8763
07:53:57 --> 07:53:59
<v MR. INHOFE>big cash payoffs while a

8764
07:53:59 --> 07:54:00
<v MR. INHOFE>regulatory train wreck was

8765
07:54:00 --> 07:54:02
<v MR. INHOFE>unleashed by the E.P.A. To

8766
07:54:02 --> 07:54:04
<v MR. INHOFE>destroy america's fossil fuel

8767
07:54:04 --> 07:54:06
<v MR. INHOFE>industry.

8768
07:54:06 --> 07:54:07
<v MR. INHOFE>The political climate is much

8769
07:54:07 --> 07:54:10
<v MR. INHOFE>different now than it was from

8770
07:54:10 --> 07:54:12
<v MR. INHOFE>the days when global warming

8771
07:54:12 --> 07:54:13
<v MR. INHOFE>alarmists could bask in their

8772
07:54:14 --> 07:54:15
<v MR. INHOFE>historical gloom and doom

8773
07:54:15 --> 07:54:15
<v MR. INHOFE>predictions about the end of the

8774
07:54:15 --> 07:54:16
<v MR. INHOFE>world.

8775
07:54:16 --> 07:54:17
<v MR. INHOFE>Now that President Obama

8776
07:54:17 --> 07:54:18
<v MR. INHOFE>wouldn't dare say anything like

8777
07:54:18 --> 07:54:21
<v MR. INHOFE>that because the american people

8778
07:54:21 --> 07:54:23
<v MR. INHOFE>no longer are buying it.

8779
07:54:23 --> 07:54:25
<v MR. INHOFE>Instead he's begun touting oil

8780
07:54:25 --> 07:54:29
<v MR. INHOFE>and gas development and saying

8781
07:54:29 --> 07:54:32
<v MR. INHOFE>that he's for an all-out,

8782
07:54:32 --> 07:54:32
<v MR. INHOFE>all-of-the-above energy

8783
07:54:32 --> 07:54:34
<v MR. INHOFE>strategy.

8784
07:54:34 --> 07:54:36
<v MR. INHOFE>He knows the americans wants the

8785
07:54:36 --> 07:54:37
<v MR. INHOFE>hundreds of thousands of jobs

8786
07:54:37 --> 07:54:39
<v MR. INHOFE>and the affordable energy prices

8787
07:54:39 --> 07:54:39
<v MR. INHOFE>that come with domestic oil and

8788
07:54:39 --> 07:54:41
<v MR. INHOFE>gas.

8789
07:54:41 --> 07:54:43
<v MR. INHOFE>But he is clearly still

8790
07:54:43 --> 07:54:45
<v MR. INHOFE>determined to achieve his global

8791
07:54:45 --> 07:54:47
<v MR. INHOFE>warming agenda, his war on

8792
07:54:47 --> 07:54:49
<v MR. INHOFE>affordable energy is moving

8793
07:54:49 --> 07:54:51
<v MR. INHOFE>underneath the radar and wrapped

8794
07:54:51 --> 07:54:54
<v MR. INHOFE>in lies about protecting public

8795
07:54:54 --> 07:54:56
<v MR. INHOFE>health but make no mistake, the

8796
07:54:56 --> 07:54:58
<v MR. INHOFE>train wreck will achieve all of

8797
07:54:58 --> 07:54:59
<v MR. INHOFE>obama's global warming

8798
07:54:59 --> 07:55:00
<v MR. INHOFE>objectives and severely

8799
07:55:00 --> 07:55:01
<v MR. INHOFE>undermine our nation's economy

8800
07:55:01 --> 07:55:04
<v MR. INHOFE>in the process.

8801
07:55:04 --> 07:55:06
<v MR. INHOFE>So I'll spend just a moment on

8802
07:55:06 --> 07:55:08
<v MR. INHOFE>that.

8803
07:55:08 --> 07:55:09
<v MR. INHOFE>The regulatory -- when

8804
07:55:09 --> 07:55:10
<v MR. INHOFE>President Obama could not

8805
07:55:10 --> 07:55:12
<v MR. INHOFE>achieve cap-and-trade through

8806
07:55:12 --> 07:55:13
<v MR. INHOFE>legislation, he said we do it

8807
07:55:13 --> 07:55:15
<v MR. INHOFE>through regulation.

8808
07:55:15 --> 07:55:19
<v MR. INHOFE>The E.P.A.'s greenhouse gas

8809
07:55:19 --> 07:55:21
<v MR. INHOFE>regime will cost americans

8810
07:55:21 --> 07:55:22
<v MR. INHOFE>between $200 billion and

8811
07:55:22 --> 07:55:24
<v MR. INHOFE>hundred billion dollars a year.

8812
07:55:24 --> 07:55:25
<v MR. INHOFE>This is important --

8813
07:55:25 --> 07:55:28
<v MR. INHOFE>$400 billion a year.

8814
07:55:28 --> 07:55:29
<v MR. INHOFE>We've gone through the kyoto

8815
07:55:29 --> 07:55:33
<v MR. INHOFE>convention, that was a figure,

8816
07:55:33 --> 07:55:35
<v MR. INHOFE>range given to it buoys by

8817
07:55:35 --> 07:55:38
<v MR. INHOFE>the -- one of the wharton,

8818
07:55:38 --> 07:55:41
<v MR. INHOFE>some of the -- it was shall,

8819
07:55:41 --> 07:55:43
<v MR. INHOFE>the wharton econometrics survey

8820
07:55:43 --> 07:55:45
<v MR. INHOFE>at that time and several other,

8821
07:55:45 --> 07:55:48
<v MR. INHOFE>m.I.T. Chimed in, C.R.A. Chimed

8822
07:55:48 --> 07:55:51
<v MR. INHOFE>in and so the cost of regulating

8823
07:55:51 --> 07:55:52
<v MR. INHOFE>greenhouse gases would be about

8824
07:55:52 --> 07:55:53
<v MR. INHOFE>$300 billion to $400 billion a

8825
07:55:53 --> 07:55:55
<v MR. INHOFE>year.

8826
07:55:55 --> 07:55:56
<v MR. INHOFE>When you talk about billions and

8827
07:55:56 --> 07:55:58
<v MR. INHOFE>trillions of dollars, I'm like

8828
07:55:58 --> 07:55:59
<v MR. INHOFE>everybody else, I have a hard

8829
07:55:59 --> 07:56:00
<v MR. INHOFE>time saying how does that really

8830
07:56:00 --> 07:56:02
<v MR. INHOFE>affect us?

8831
07:56:02 --> 07:56:04
<v MR. INHOFE>In my state of oklahoma I

8832
07:56:04 --> 07:56:07
<v MR. INHOFE>regularly determine each year

8833
07:56:07 --> 07:56:09
<v MR. INHOFE>how many families in my state of

8834
07:56:09 --> 07:56:11
<v MR. INHOFE>oklahoma are going to file a tax

8835
07:56:11 --> 07:56:13
<v MR. INHOFE>return, then I do the math.

8836
07:56:13 --> 07:56:15
<v MR. INHOFE>This particular one at

8837
07:56:15 --> 07:56:17
<v MR. INHOFE>$300 billion a year would cost

8838
07:56:17 --> 07:56:21
<v MR. INHOFE>each family filing a tax return

8839
07:56:21 --> 07:56:23
<v MR. INHOFE>in my state of oklahoma about

8840
07:56:23 --> 07:56:23
<v MR. INHOFE>$300 billion -- about $3,000 a

8841
07:56:23 --> 07:56:25
<v MR. INHOFE>year.

8842
07:56:25 --> 07:56:26
<v MR. INHOFE>Not once, that would be every

8843
07:56:26 --> 07:56:28
<v MR. INHOFE>year.

8844
07:56:28 --> 07:56:29
<v MR. INHOFE>what do you get for it?

8845
07:56:29 --> 07:56:31
<v MR. INHOFE>This is the thing the american

8846
07:56:31 --> 07:56:33
<v MR. INHOFE>people have finally caught on,

8847
07:56:33 --> 07:56:34
<v MR. INHOFE>they have admitted that through

8848
07:56:34 --> 07:56:37
<v MR. INHOFE>the E.P.A. When you ask them if

8849
07:56:37 --> 07:56:41
<v MR. INHOFE>we were to pass one of these

8850
07:56:41 --> 07:56:42
<v MR. INHOFE>things regulating Co2 through

8851
07:56:42 --> 07:56:44
<v MR. INHOFE>the cap-and-trade legislation

8852
07:56:44 --> 07:56:46
<v MR. INHOFE>that we have defeated, would

8853
07:56:46 --> 07:56:49
<v MR. INHOFE>this reduce greenhouse gases?

8854
07:56:49 --> 07:56:50
<v MR. INHOFE>and the answer from the director

8855
07:56:50 --> 07:56:52
<v MR. INHOFE>or the administrator of the

8856
07:56:52 --> 07:56:53
<v MR. INHOFE>E.P.A. Is no it wouldn't because

8857
07:56:53 --> 07:56:54
<v MR. INHOFE>this only would affect united

8858
07:56:54 --> 07:56:56
<v MR. INHOFE>states of america.

8859
07:56:56 --> 07:56:58
<v MR. INHOFE>This isn't where the problem is.

8860
07:56:58 --> 07:57:00
<v MR. INHOFE>China would still be doing its

8861
07:57:00 --> 07:57:01
<v MR. INHOFE>thing, india would be doing its

8862
07:57:01 --> 07:57:04
<v MR. INHOFE>thing, mexico.

8863
07:57:04 --> 07:57:04
<v MR. INHOFE>I contend if you are regulating

8864
07:57:04 --> 07:57:06
<v MR. INHOFE>these in the united states you

8865
07:57:06 --> 07:57:08
<v MR. INHOFE>could actually have the effect

8866
07:57:08 --> 07:57:10
<v MR. INHOFE>of increasing the emissions

8867
07:57:10 --> 07:57:13
<v MR. INHOFE>because as we chase our

8868
07:57:13 --> 07:57:14
<v MR. INHOFE>manufacturing base overseas to

8869
07:57:14 --> 07:57:15
<v MR. INHOFE>find energy, they would be

8870
07:57:15 --> 07:57:17
<v MR. INHOFE>going to countries like china,

8871
07:57:17 --> 07:57:20
<v MR. INHOFE>like india where they don't have

8872
07:57:20 --> 07:57:21
<v MR. INHOFE>the regulatory -- the

8873
07:57:21 --> 07:57:25
<v MR. INHOFE>restrictions on -- that we have

8874
07:57:25 --> 07:57:29
<v MR. INHOFE>in this country.

8875
07:57:29 --> 07:57:31
<v MR. INHOFE>so the -- the -- that

8876
07:57:31 --> 07:57:34
<v MR. INHOFE>particular thing or the utility

8877
07:57:34 --> 07:57:36
<v MR. INHOFE>mact rule is second only to the

8878
07:57:36 --> 07:57:38
<v MR. INHOFE>greenhouse gas regulations in

8879
07:57:38 --> 07:57:41
<v MR. INHOFE>terms of what it would cost in

8880
07:57:41 --> 07:57:44
<v MR. INHOFE>terms of costing the people, in

8881
07:57:44 --> 07:57:45
<v MR. INHOFE>terms of jobs and of money.

8882
07:57:45 --> 07:57:47
<v MR. INHOFE>And actually the regulatory

8883
07:57:47 --> 07:57:49
<v MR. INHOFE>thing would be worse when you're

8884
07:57:49 --> 07:57:52
<v MR. INHOFE>talking about greenhouse gases

8885
07:57:52 --> 07:57:54
<v MR. INHOFE>because under the bills that

8886
07:57:54 --> 07:57:57
<v MR. INHOFE>were introduced, and starting

8887
07:57:57 --> 07:57:57
<v MR. INHOFE>in 2003, that was the

8888
07:57:57 --> 07:58:00
<v MR. INHOFE>Mccain-lieberman bill going

8889
07:58:00 --> 07:58:01
<v MR. INHOFE>all the way forward to the

8890
07:58:01 --> 07:58:02
<v MR. INHOFE>waxman-markey bill.

8891
07:58:02 --> 07:58:05
<v MR. INHOFE>The assumption has been that

8892
07:58:05 --> 07:58:08
<v MR. INHOFE>they would use -- that they

8893
07:58:08 --> 07:58:11
<v MR. INHOFE>would regulate industries in --

8894
07:58:11 --> 07:58:11
<v MR. INHOFE>and emitters over the

8895
07:58:11 --> 07:58:13
<v MR. INHOFE>25,000 tons a year.

8896
07:58:13 --> 07:58:14
<v MR. INHOFE>If you do it through regulation

8897
07:58:14 --> 07:58:17
<v MR. INHOFE>as they're trying to do it right

8898
07:58:17 --> 07:58:19
<v MR. INHOFE>now, the clean air act has a

8899
07:58:19 --> 07:58:21
<v MR. INHOFE>limit of 250 tons.

8900
07:58:21 --> 07:58:23
<v MR. INHOFE>So you'd be talking about

8901
07:58:23 --> 07:58:25
<v MR. INHOFE>regulating virtually every

8902
07:58:25 --> 07:58:26
<v MR. INHOFE>church, school, hospital in

8903
07:58:26 --> 07:58:28
<v MR. INHOFE>america.

8904
07:58:28 --> 07:58:28
<v MR. INHOFE>And not just the very large

8905
07:58:28 --> 07:58:30
<v MR. INHOFE>utilities.

8906
07:58:30 --> 07:58:32
<v MR. INHOFE>So anyway, that's -- that's

8907
07:58:32 --> 07:58:34
<v MR. INHOFE>where we were on that issue.

8908
07:58:34 --> 07:58:36
<v MR. INHOFE>On oil, President Obama's been

8909
07:58:36 --> 07:58:38
<v MR. INHOFE>congratulating himself on

8910
07:58:38 --> 07:58:39
<v MR. INHOFE>decreasing the imports of oil

8911
07:58:39 --> 07:58:41
<v MR. INHOFE>from the middle east but fails

8912
07:58:41 --> 07:58:43
<v MR. INHOFE>to mention that his policies

8913
07:58:43 --> 07:58:44
<v MR. INHOFE>have been consistently against

8914
07:58:44 --> 07:58:46
<v MR. INHOFE>oil and gas.

8915
07:58:46 --> 07:58:48
<v MR. INHOFE>In fact, he has actually said

8916
07:58:48 --> 07:58:49
<v MR. INHOFE>in people in his administration

8917
07:58:49 --> 07:58:52
<v MR. INHOFE>have said that they want to do

8918
07:58:52 --> 07:58:55
<v MR. INHOFE>away with fossil fuels.

8919
07:58:55 --> 07:58:56
<v MR. INHOFE>Secretary of energy steven chu

8920
07:58:56 --> 07:58:58
<v MR. INHOFE>said they wanted -- quote --

8921
07:58:58 --> 07:59:01
<v MR. INHOFE>&quot;boost the price of gasoline to

8922
07:59:01 --> 07:59:04
<v MR. INHOFE>the levels in europe.&quot;

8923
07:59:04 --> 07:59:05
<v MR. INHOFE>well, that's $7 or 8 dollars a

8924
07:59:05 --> 07:59:06
<v MR. INHOFE>gallon.

8925
07:59:06 --> 07:59:07
<v MR. INHOFE>Now we're looking at $4 a today

8926
07:59:07 --> 07:59:08
<v MR. INHOFE>gallon.

8927
07:59:08 --> 07:59:12
<v MR. INHOFE>What's their motive?

8928
07:59:12 --> 07:59:14
<v MR. INHOFE>to do away with fossil fuels.

8929
07:59:14 --> 07:59:17
<v MR. INHOFE>He stopped the keystone

8930
07:59:17 --> 07:59:19
<v MR. INHOFE>pipeline, the keystone pipeline

8931
07:59:19 --> 07:59:20
<v MR. INHOFE>I'm very proud of a lot of the

8932
07:59:20 --> 07:59:22
<v MR. INHOFE>individuals, the senators in

8933
07:59:22 --> 07:59:23
<v MR. INHOFE>here who have talked about

8934
07:59:23 --> 07:59:24
<v MR. INHOFE>that, senator hoeven, for

8935
07:59:24 --> 07:59:26
<v MR. INHOFE>example, is very familiar with

8936
07:59:26 --> 07:59:27
<v MR. INHOFE>it because of the production in

8937
07:59:27 --> 07:59:28
<v MR. INHOFE>his state.

8938
07:59:28 --> 07:59:30
<v MR. INHOFE>Now we're talking here about the

8939
07:59:30 --> 07:59:32
<v MR. INHOFE>sands up in alberta and bringing

8940
07:59:32 --> 07:59:32
<v MR. INHOFE>them down through the united

8941
07:59:32 --> 07:59:34
<v MR. INHOFE>states.

8942
07:59:34 --> 07:59:36
<v MR. INHOFE>So I'm interested in this

8943
07:59:36 --> 07:59:38
<v MR. INHOFE>because cushing, oklahoma

8944
07:59:38 --> 07:59:39
<v MR. INHOFE>happens to be one of the

8945
07:59:39 --> 07:59:41
<v MR. INHOFE>intersections that is there for

8946
07:59:41 --> 07:59:43
<v MR. INHOFE>the -- for the pipeline.

8947
07:59:43 --> 07:59:46
<v MR. INHOFE>And so here's something that

8948
07:59:46 --> 07:59:48
<v MR. INHOFE>there is absolutely no reason to

8949
07:59:48 --> 07:59:49
<v MR. INHOFE>do away with except to kill oil

8950
07:59:49 --> 07:59:52
<v MR. INHOFE>because we know the pipeline is

8951
07:59:52 --> 07:59:54
<v MR. INHOFE>going to bring oil and bring

8952
07:59:54 --> 07:59:55
<v MR. INHOFE>down into the united states

8953
07:59:55 --> 07:59:57
<v MR. INHOFE>through, I might say my state

8954
07:59:57 --> 07:59:59
<v MR. INHOFE>of oklahoma, down to the

8955
07:59:59 --> 08:00:01
<v MR. INHOFE>coast, where it can be used.

8956
08:00:01 --> 08:00:02
<v MR. INHOFE>And here we are and a lot of

8957
08:00:02 --> 08:00:03
<v MR. INHOFE>people don't understand this

8958
08:00:03 --> 08:00:05
<v MR. INHOFE>because they've been told things

8959
08:00:05 --> 08:00:08
<v MR. INHOFE>that frankly are not true.

8960
08:00:08 --> 08:00:09
<v MR. INHOFE>In terms of oil, gas, and

8961
08:00:09 --> 08:00:11
<v MR. INHOFE>coal, the united states of

8962
08:00:11 --> 08:00:13
<v MR. INHOFE>america has the largest

8963
08:00:13 --> 08:00:14
<v MR. INHOFE>recoveriable reserves in the

8964
08:00:14 --> 08:00:15
<v MR. INHOFE>world.

8965
08:00:15 --> 08:00:17
<v MR. INHOFE>People keep saying over and over

8966
08:00:17 --> 08:00:20
<v MR. INHOFE>again we only have 3% of the

8967
08:00:20 --> 08:00:22
<v MR. INHOFE>reserves and yet we use 25%.

8968
08:00:22 --> 08:00:23
<v MR. INHOFE>Well, quite frankly they're

8969
08:00:23 --> 08:00:27
<v MR. INHOFE>talking about proven reserves.

8970
08:00:27 --> 08:00:28
<v MR. INHOFE>You can't get a proven -- a

8971
08:00:28 --> 08:00:30
<v MR. INHOFE>recoverable reserve until you

8972
08:00:30 --> 08:00:31
<v MR. INHOFE>drill and if they don't let us

8973
08:00:31 --> 08:00:33
<v MR. INHOFE>drill because of the policies of

8974
08:00:33 --> 08:00:35
<v MR. INHOFE>this administration, then

8975
08:00:35 --> 08:00:37
<v MR. INHOFE>obviously we would be stuck with

8976
08:00:37 --> 08:00:38
<v MR. INHOFE>just the very small amount that

8977
08:00:38 --> 08:00:39
<v MR. INHOFE>we could produce.

8978
08:00:39 --> 08:00:41
<v MR. INHOFE>Nonetheless, it's out there.

8979
08:00:41 --> 08:00:45
<v MR. INHOFE>We're the only country in the

8980
08:00:45 --> 08:00:47
<v MR. INHOFE>world that doesn't allow --

8981
08:00:47 --> 08:00:49
<v MR. INHOFE>that our politicians don't allow

8982
08:00:49 --> 08:00:49
<v MR. INHOFE>us to explore and recover our

8983
08:00:49 --> 08:00:51
<v MR. INHOFE>own reserves.

8984
08:00:51 --> 08:00:53
<v MR. INHOFE>the only country in the world.

8985
08:00:53 --> 08:00:54
<v MR. INHOFE>Natural gas gast, we know

8986
08:00:54 --> 08:00:57
<v MR. INHOFE>what's happening right now, we

8987
08:00:57 --> 08:01:00
<v MR. INHOFE>know in areas like new york and

8988
08:01:00 --> 08:01:01
<v MR. INHOFE>pennsylvania the marcellus, we

8989
08:01:01 --> 08:01:02
<v MR. INHOFE>have opportunities that we have

8990
08:01:02 --> 08:01:03
<v MR. INHOFE>not had, we've never had in

8991
08:01:03 --> 08:01:06
<v MR. INHOFE>this country.

8992
08:01:06 --> 08:01:08
<v MR. INHOFE>We have the opportunity to

8993
08:01:08 --> 08:01:11
<v MR. INHOFE>recover more natural gas, and

8994
08:01:11 --> 08:01:12
<v MR. INHOFE>when the President Had made a

8995
08:01:12 --> 08:01:13
<v MR. INHOFE>statement in the state of the

8996
08:01:13 --> 08:01:15
<v MR. INHOFE>union message about being

8997
08:01:15 --> 08:01:16
<v MR. INHOFE>supporting of all of the above

8998
08:01:16 --> 08:01:18
<v MR. INHOFE>in talking about natural gas,

8999
08:01:18 --> 08:01:19
<v MR. INHOFE>he slipped in one little

9000
08:01:19 --> 08:01:21
<v MR. INHOFE>statement there that says, well,

9001
08:01:21 --> 08:01:22
<v MR. INHOFE>we don't want to poison the

9002
08:01:22 --> 08:01:24
<v MR. INHOFE>earth, something like that.

9003
08:01:24 --> 08:01:27
<v MR. INHOFE>What he's talking about is,

9004
08:01:27 --> 08:01:30
<v MR. INHOFE>they have spent countless hours

9005
08:01:30 --> 08:01:33
<v MR. INHOFE>trying to regulate a process

9006
08:01:33 --> 08:01:34
<v MR. INHOFE>called hydraulic fracturing, a

9007
08:01:34 --> 08:01:38
<v MR. INHOFE>process that started in my state

9008
08:01:38 --> 08:01:39
<v MR. INHOFE>of oklahoma in 199 and there's

9009
08:01:39 --> 08:01:42
<v MR. INHOFE>never -- 1949 and there's never

9010
08:01:42 --> 08:01:43
<v MR. INHOFE>between a documented case of

9011
08:01:43 --> 08:01:46
<v MR. INHOFE>groundwater contamination tennis

9012
08:01:46 --> 08:01:46
<v MR. INHOFE>sips they are started using

9013
08:01:46 --> 08:01:48
<v MR. INHOFE>hydraulic fracture.

9014
08:01:48 --> 08:01:51
<v MR. INHOFE>You can't get into these tight

9015
08:01:51 --> 08:01:51
<v MR. INHOFE>formations without hydraulic

9016
08:01:51 --> 08:01:52
<v MR. INHOFE>fracturing.

9017
08:01:52 --> 08:01:54
<v MR. INHOFE>It can't be done.

9018
08:01:54 --> 08:01:55
<v MR. INHOFE>so the President Can get by with

9019
08:01:55 --> 08:01:57
<v MR. INHOFE>saying he wants to produce the

9020
08:01:57 --> 08:01:58
<v MR. INHOFE>natural gas we have locally

9021
08:01:58 --> 08:02:02
<v MR. INHOFE>here, at the same time take

9022
08:02:02 --> 08:02:02
<v MR. INHOFE>over the regulation of hydraulic

9023
08:02:02 --> 08:02:03
<v MR. INHOFE>fracturing by the federal

9024
08:02:03 --> 08:02:04
<v MR. INHOFE>government.

9025
08:02:04 --> 08:02:05
<v MR. INHOFE>We know bha what that would

9026
08:02:05 --> 08:02:06
<v MR. INHOFE>mean.

9027
08:02:06 --> 08:02:09
<v MR. INHOFE>The best evidence of that is

9028
08:02:09 --> 08:02:10
<v MR. INHOFE>President Obama in his current

9029
08:02:10 --> 08:02:13
<v MR. INHOFE>budget is doubling the funding

9030
08:02:13 --> 08:02:15
<v MR. INHOFE>for the anti-fast tracking

9031
08:02:15 --> 08:02:18
<v MR. INHOFE>agenda -- anti-fracking agenda

9032
08:02:18 --> 08:02:21
<v MR. INHOFE>in the 2013 budget.

9033
08:02:21 --> 08:02:23
<v MR. INHOFE>Nuclear, that's agreed to, we

9034
08:02:23 --> 08:02:24
<v MR. INHOFE>really believe in all of the

9035
08:02:24 --> 08:02:26
<v MR. INHOFE>above, you have to have fossil

9036
08:02:26 --> 08:02:27
<v MR. INHOFE>fuels, coal, oil, and gas and

9037
08:02:27 --> 08:02:29
<v MR. INHOFE>also nuclear.

9038
08:02:29 --> 08:02:32
<v MR. INHOFE>It's

9039
08:02:32 --> 08:02:34
<v MR. INHOFE>a very important component.

9040
08:02:34 --> 08:02:35
<v MR. INHOFE>it was interesting that only

9041
08:02:35 --> 08:02:36
<v MR. INHOFE>yesterday President Obama sent

9042
08:02:36 --> 08:02:40
<v MR. INHOFE>his energy secretary to georgia

9043
08:02:40 --> 08:02:41
<v MR. INHOFE>to take credit for the 5,800

9044
08:02:41 --> 08:02:43
<v MR. INHOFE>jobs that will be created when

9045
08:02:43 --> 08:02:44
<v MR. INHOFE>two nuclear reactors are built

9046
08:02:44 --> 08:02:46
<v MR. INHOFE>there.

9047
08:02:46 --> 08:02:48
<v MR. INHOFE>As secretary chu said

9048
08:02:48 --> 08:02:49
<v MR. INHOFE>yesterday -- now listen to this

9049
08:02:49 --> 08:02:50
<v MR. INHOFE>quote -- he said, in his state

9050
08:02:50 --> 08:02:51
<v MR. INHOFE>of the union address, President

9051
08:02:51 --> 08:02:52
<v MR. INHOFE>Obama outlined a blueprint for

9052
08:02:52 --> 08:02:54
<v MR. INHOFE>an american economy that is

9053
08:02:54 --> 08:02:56
<v MR. INHOFE>built to last and develops every

9054
08:02:56 --> 08:02:56
<v MR. INHOFE>available source of american

9055
08:02:56 --> 08:02:58
<v MR. INHOFE>energy.

9056
08:02:58 --> 08:02:59
<v MR. INHOFE>Nuclear power is an important

9057
08:02:59 --> 08:03:03
<v MR. INHOFE>part of that blueprint.

9058
08:03:03 --> 08:03:03
<v MR. INHOFE>Yeah, nuclear power is so

9059
08:03:03 --> 08:03:05
<v MR. INHOFE>important that President Obama

9060
08:03:05 --> 08:03:07
<v MR. INHOFE>forgot to mention it in his --

9061
08:03:07 --> 08:03:08
<v MR. INHOFE>his very long state of the union

9062
08:03:08 --> 08:03:10
<v MR. INHOFE>message.

9063
08:03:10 --> 08:03:12
<v MR. INHOFE>And to send secretary chu to

9064
08:03:12 --> 08:03:14
<v MR. INHOFE>georgia is kind of ironic given

9065
08:03:14 --> 08:03:16
<v MR. INHOFE>that chu is the one who said

9066
08:03:16 --> 08:03:18
<v MR. INHOFE>that nuclear power is the lesser

9067
08:03:18 --> 08:03:19
<v MR. INHOFE>of two evils.

9068
08:03:19 --> 08:03:21
<v MR. INHOFE>And it was President -- the

9069
08:03:21 --> 08:03:23
<v MR. INHOFE>President Himself who designated

9070
08:03:23 --> 08:03:24
<v MR. INHOFE>a Chairman Of the nuclear

9071
08:03:24 --> 08:03:26
<v MR. INHOFE>regulatory commission who had

9072
08:03:26 --> 08:03:31
<v MR. INHOFE>been leading the antinuclear

9073
08:03:31 --> 08:03:36
<v MR. INHOFE>energy for quite some time as

9074
08:03:36 --> 08:03:37
<v MR. INHOFE>chairman yascoe tried to delay

9075
08:03:37 --> 08:03:38
<v MR. INHOFE>the licensing on the very

9076
08:03:38 --> 08:03:40
<v MR. INHOFE>reactors in george that they

9077
08:03:40 --> 08:03:40
<v MR. INHOFE>went up to try to take credit

9078
08:03:40 --> 08:03:41
<v MR. INHOFE>for.

9079
08:03:41 --> 08:03:42
<v MR. INHOFE>We just -- we see this over and

9080
08:03:42 --> 08:03:44
<v MR. INHOFE>over again.

9081
08:03:44 --> 08:03:45
<v MR. INHOFE>Well, what does this all mean?

9082
08:03:45 --> 08:03:46
<v MR. INHOFE>President Obama knows he needs

9083
08:03:46 --> 08:03:48
<v MR. INHOFE>to talk the talk on domestic

9084
08:03:48 --> 08:03:50
<v MR. INHOFE>energy because people have

9085
08:03:50 --> 08:03:52
<v MR. INHOFE>caught on to the fact -- I think

9086
08:03:52 --> 08:03:53
<v MR. INHOFE>people know now that we have the

9087
08:03:53 --> 08:03:54
<v MR. INHOFE>recoverable reserve to be

9088
08:03:54 --> 08:03:54
<v MR. INHOFE>completely free from the middle

9089
08:03:54 --> 08:03:56
<v MR. INHOFE>east.

9090
08:03:56 --> 08:03:59
<v MR. INHOFE>All we have to do in a short

9091
08:03:59 --> 08:04:00
<v MR. INHOFE>period of time is to develop our

9092
08:04:00 --> 08:04:02
<v MR. INHOFE>own resources.

9093
08:04:02 --> 08:04:03
<v MR. INHOFE>Now, I know that my

9094
08:04:03 --> 08:04:05
<v MR. INHOFE>environmental friends are

9095
08:04:06 --> 08:04:10
<v MR. INHOFE>already saying about the C.R.A.

9096
08:04:10 --> 08:04:12
<v MR. INHOFE>On -- on utility mact.

9097
08:04:12 --> 08:04:14
<v MR. INHOFE>The nrct jumped on the story

9098
08:04:14 --> 08:04:16
<v MR. INHOFE>today with the headline, &quot;let

9099
08:04:16 --> 08:04:17
<v MR. INHOFE>loose the defenders of mercury

9100
08:04:17 --> 08:04:18
<v MR. INHOFE>poisoning.&quot;

9101
08:04:18 --> 08:04:18
<v MR. INHOFE>and nothing could be further

9102
08:04:18 --> 08:04:21
<v MR. INHOFE>from the truth.

9103
08:04:21 --> 08:04:23
<v MR. INHOFE>I remember so well in 2003 and

9104
08:04:23 --> 08:04:24
<v MR. INHOFE>2005 when we had the &quot;clear

9105
08:04:24 --> 08:04:26
<v MR. INHOFE>skies&quot; bill.

9106
08:04:26 --> 08:04:27
<v MR. INHOFE>The clear skies bill would have

9107
08:04:27 --> 08:04:29
<v MR. INHOFE>had mandatory reductions.

9108
08:04:29 --> 08:04:30
<v MR. INHOFE>Keep in mind we're talking about

9109
08:04:30 --> 08:04:31
<v MR. INHOFE>2003.

9110
08:04:31 --> 08:04:35
<v MR. INHOFE>Mandatory reductions on mercury

9111
08:04:35 --> 08:04:37
<v MR. INHOFE>by 70% by 2018.

9112
08:04:37 --> 08:04:38
<v MR. INHOFE>Well, that was back in -- so it

9113
08:04:38 --> 08:04:40
<v MR. INHOFE>was just a matter of a few years

9114
08:04:40 --> 08:04:40
<v MR. INHOFE>from now, that would be a

9115
08:04:40 --> 08:04:41
<v MR. INHOFE>reality.

9116
08:04:41 --> 08:04:43
<v MR. INHOFE>Just think about it.

9117
08:04:44 --> 08:04:45
<v MR. INHOFE>In just six years from now, we'd

9118
08:04:45 --> 08:04:47
<v MR. INHOFE>already have a 70% reduction

9119
08:04:47 --> 08:04:48
<v MR. INHOFE>and -- and if the democrats

9120
08:04:48 --> 08:04:49
<v MR. INHOFE>hadn't stopped the bill.

9121
08:04:49 --> 08:04:53
<v MR. INHOFE>And the reason they did is

9122
08:04:53 --> 08:04:54
<v MR. INHOFE>because they -- they -- we

9123
08:04:54 --> 08:04:56
<v MR. INHOFE>refused -- we wanted to have

9124
08:04:56 --> 08:04:59
<v MR. INHOFE>sox, knox and mercury, that are

9125
08:04:59 --> 08:05:02
<v MR. INHOFE>the real pollutants, reduced and

9126
08:05:02 --> 08:05:03
<v MR. INHOFE>reduced in that rapid of a

9127
08:05:03 --> 08:05:04
<v MR. INHOFE>fashion.

9128
08:05:04 --> 08:05:04
<v MR. INHOFE>Faster than senator -- than

9129
08:05:04 --> 08:05:06
<v MR. INHOFE>President Clinton or anybody

9130
08:05:06 --> 08:05:08
<v MR. INHOFE>else has tried to do it.

9131
08:05:08 --> 08:05:09
<v MR. INHOFE>And they held it hostage because

9132
08:05:09 --> 08:05:10
<v MR. INHOFE>they also wanted Co2 included

9133
08:05:10 --> 08:05:11
<v MR. INHOFE>in it.

9134
08:05:12 --> 08:05:13
<v MR. INHOFE>So we got none of the above as a

9135
08:05:13 --> 08:05:18
<v MR. INHOFE>result of it.

9136
08:05:18 --> 08:05:20
<v MR. INHOFE>so the E.P.A.'s utility mact is

9137
08:05:20 --> 08:05:22
<v MR. INHOFE>designed to destroy jobs by

9138
08:05:22 --> 08:05:24
<v MR. INHOFE>killing off the coal industry.

9139
08:05:24 --> 08:05:27
<v MR. INHOFE>E.P.A. Admits itself that

9140
08:05:27 --> 08:05:29
<v MR. INHOFE>utility mact rule will cost an

9141
08:05:29 --> 08:05:29
<v MR. INHOFE>unprecedented $11 billion to

9142
08:05:29 --> 08:05:30
<v MR. INHOFE>implement.

9143
08:05:30 --> 08:05:31
<v MR. INHOFE>And, of course, these costs will

9144
08:05:31 --> 08:05:33
<v MR. INHOFE>come in the form of higher

9145
08:05:33 --> 08:05:35
<v MR. INHOFE>electricity rates for every

9146
08:05:35 --> 08:05:36
<v MR. INHOFE>american.

9147
08:05:36 --> 08:05:39
<v MR. INHOFE>importantly, the E.P.A. Also

9148
08:05:39 --> 08:05:41
<v MR. INHOFE>admits that the $11 billion in

9149
08:05:41 --> 08:05:42
<v MR. INHOFE>costs will yield a mere

9150
08:05:42 --> 08:05:43
<v MR. INHOFE>$6 million in direct benefits.

9151
08:05:43 --> 08:05:46
<v MR. INHOFE>Well, do the math there.

9152
08:05:46 --> 08:05:47
<v MR. INHOFE>It means that the agency has, by

9153
08:05:47 --> 08:05:50
<v MR. INHOFE>its own admission, completely

9154
08:05:50 --> 08:05:51
<v MR. INHOFE>failed the cost-benefit test.

9155
08:05:51 --> 08:05:53
<v MR. INHOFE>When clear skies had the

9156
08:05:53 --> 08:05:55
<v MR. INHOFE>advantage of reducing emissions

9157
08:05:55 --> 08:05:57
<v MR. INHOFE>without killing jobs and the

9158
08:05:57 --> 08:05:59
<v MR. INHOFE>e.P.A.'s utility mact would do

9159
08:05:59 --> 08:06:01
<v MR. INHOFE>the -- would do little for the

9160
08:06:01 --> 08:06:02
<v MR. INHOFE>environment but destroy millions

9161
08:06:02 --> 08:06:03
<v MR. INHOFE>of jobs.

9162
08:06:03 --> 08:06:06
<v MR. INHOFE>Why did clear skies fail?

9163
08:06:06 --> 08:06:07
<v MR. INHOFE>As I said, it was held hostage

9164
08:06:07 --> 08:06:09
<v MR. INHOFE>because, why?

9165
08:06:09 --> 08:06:10
<v MR. INHOFE>We didn't want to reduce just

9166
08:06:10 --> 08:06:11
<v MR. INHOFE>SOx, NOx and mercury.

9167
08:06:11 --> 08:06:13
<v MR. INHOFE>The real pollutants.

9168
08:06:13 --> 08:06:14
<v MR. INHOFE>They wanted to include Co2

9169
08:06:14 --> 08:06:15
<v MR. INHOFE>also.

9170
08:06:15 --> 08:06:19
<v MR. INHOFE>Just before President Obama's

9171
08:06:19 --> 08:06:20
<v MR. INHOFE>decision to halt the ozone rule

9172
08:06:20 --> 08:06:21
<v MR. INHOFE>which would have put hundreds of

9173
08:06:21 --> 08:06:24
<v MR. INHOFE>thousands of people -- job at

9174
08:06:24 --> 08:06:26
<v MR. INHOFE>risk, then-white house chief of

9175
08:06:26 --> 08:06:27
<v MR. INHOFE>staff bill daly asked, what are

9176
08:06:27 --> 08:06:27
<v MR. INHOFE>the health impacts of

9177
08:06:27 --> 08:06:29
<v MR. INHOFE>unemployment?

9178
08:06:29 --> 08:06:31
<v MR. INHOFE>Well, that's a good question.

9179
08:06:31 --> 08:06:33
<v MR. INHOFE>What are the health impacts of

9180
08:06:33 --> 08:06:34
<v MR. INHOFE>skyrocketing electricity rates,

9181
08:06:34 --> 08:06:36
<v MR. INHOFE>which hurt the poor the most?

9182
08:06:36 --> 08:06:39
<v MR. INHOFE>what are the health impacts on

9183
08:06:39 --> 08:06:41
<v MR. INHOFE>children whose parents will lose

9184
08:06:41 --> 08:06:43
<v MR. INHOFE>one of the 1.4 million jobs that

9185
08:06:43 --> 08:06:45
<v MR. INHOFE>will be destroyed by the

9186
08:06:45 --> 08:06:45
<v MR. INHOFE>E.P.A.'s rule -- rules on power

9187
08:06:45 --> 08:06:47
<v MR. INHOFE>plants.

9188
08:06:47 --> 08:06:50
<v MR. INHOFE>The united states senate needs

9189
08:06:50 --> 08:06:52
<v MR. INHOFE>to focus on promoting policies

9190
08:06:52 --> 08:06:53
<v MR. INHOFE>to -- that improve our

9191
08:06:53 --> 08:06:54
<v MR. INHOFE>environment without harming our

9192
08:06:54 --> 08:06:57
<v MR. INHOFE>economy.

9193
08:06:57 --> 08:07:00
<v MR. INHOFE>the E.P.A.'s utility mact does

9194
08:07:00 --> 08:07:01
<v MR. INHOFE>just the opposite.

9195
08:07:01 --> 08:07:03
<v MR. INHOFE>C.R.A., I think it's one -- they

9196
08:07:03 --> 08:07:03
<v MR. INHOFE>say well, you'll never get it

9197
08:07:03 --> 08:07:04
<v MR. INHOFE>done.

9198
08:07:04 --> 08:07:06
<v MR. INHOFE>And I've criticized people for

9199
08:07:06 --> 08:07:07
<v MR. INHOFE>bringing a congressional review

9200
08:07:07 --> 08:07:09
<v MR. INHOFE>act up against regulations where

9201
08:07:09 --> 08:07:10
<v MR. INHOFE>I know the votes aren't there.

9202
08:07:10 --> 08:07:12
<v MR. INHOFE>It takes just 51 votes.

9203
08:07:12 --> 08:07:14
<v MR. INHOFE>And the reason I think the votes

9204
08:07:14 --> 08:07:16
<v MR. INHOFE>should be here now, if people

9205
08:07:16 --> 08:07:17
<v MR. INHOFE>understand, people at home care

9206
08:07:17 --> 08:07:19
<v MR. INHOFE>enough to put the pressure on,

9207
08:07:19 --> 08:07:20
<v MR. INHOFE>that's exactly what happened on

9208
08:07:20 --> 08:07:22
<v MR. INHOFE>the ozone requirements.

9209
08:07:22 --> 08:07:25
<v MR. INHOFE>They said, well, the President

9210
08:07:25 --> 08:07:25
<v MR. INHOFE>Was committed to his own ozone

9211
08:07:25 --> 08:07:27
<v MR. INHOFE>changes.

9212
08:07:27 --> 08:07:27
<v MR. INHOFE>He changed his mind because of

9213
08:07:27 --> 08:07:30
<v MR. INHOFE>that.

9214
08:07:30 --> 08:07:32
<v MR. INHOFE>Remember the farm dust rule?

9215
08:07:32 --> 08:07:34
<v MR. INHOFE>The President Was going to have

9216
08:07:34 --> 08:07:35
<v MR. INHOFE>a -- a farm dust rule on

9217
08:07:35 --> 08:07:36
<v MR. INHOFE>emissions that would hit the air

9218
08:07:36 --> 08:07:37
<v MR. INHOFE>air.

9219
08:07:37 --> 08:07:39
<v MR. INHOFE>and I always remember, I had a

9220
08:07:39 --> 08:07:40
<v MR. INHOFE>news conference in my state of

9221
08:07:40 --> 08:07:41
<v MR. INHOFE>oklahoma, in the western part of

9222
08:07:41 --> 08:07:42
<v MR. INHOFE>the state.

9223
08:07:42 --> 08:07:44
<v MR. INHOFE>We had a couple people there

9224
08:07:44 --> 08:07:46
<v MR. INHOFE>from washington who had never

9225
08:07:46 --> 08:07:49
<v MR. INHOFE>been west of the mississippi.

9226
08:07:49 --> 08:07:52
<v MR. INHOFE>And we got down there in this

9227
08:07:52 --> 08:07:53
<v MR. INHOFE>area -- area of oklahoma and

9228
08:07:53 --> 08:07:54
<v MR. INHOFE>we're talking about farm dust,

9229
08:07:54 --> 08:07:56
<v MR. INHOFE>and I said, well, you see this

9230
08:07:56 --> 08:07:57
<v MR. INHOFE>brown stuff down here?

9231
08:07:57 --> 08:07:59
<v MR. INHOFE>That's dirt.

9232
08:07:59 --> 08:07:59
<v MR. INHOFE>and you see that round green

9233
08:07:59 --> 08:08:00
<v MR. INHOFE>thing?

9234
08:08:00 --> 08:08:01
<v MR. INHOFE>That's cotton.

9235
08:08:01 --> 08:08:02
<v MR. INHOFE>Now, hold your finger up there.

9236
08:08:02 --> 08:08:03
<v MR. INHOFE>That's wind.

9237
08:08:03 --> 08:08:05
<v MR. INHOFE>Are there any questions?

9238
08:08:05 --> 08:08:06
<v MR. INHOFE>There's no technology to do that

9239
08:08:06 --> 08:08:08
<v MR. INHOFE>that, and yet the expense to

9240
08:08:08 --> 08:08:10
<v MR. INHOFE>each of my farmers in a farm

9241
08:08:10 --> 08:08:11
<v MR. INHOFE>state like oklahoma would have

9242
08:08:11 --> 08:08:12
<v MR. INHOFE>been hundreds of dollars a year

9243
08:08:12 --> 08:08:15
<v MR. INHOFE>and not accomplishing anything.

9244
08:08:15 --> 08:08:17
<v MR. INHOFE>Well, we were able to get the

9245
08:08:17 --> 08:08:17
<v MR. INHOFE>public to write in to complain

9246
08:08:17 --> 08:08:19
<v MR. INHOFE>about that.

9247
08:08:19 --> 08:08:20
<v MR. INHOFE>And as a result of that, the

9248
08:08:20 --> 08:08:22
<v MR. INHOFE>President Pulled off.

9249
08:08:22 --> 08:08:23
<v MR. INHOFE>So I -- I would just hope that

9250
08:08:23 --> 08:08:26
<v MR. INHOFE>enough people are concerned

9251
08:08:26 --> 08:08:26
<v MR. INHOFE>about utility mact and its

9252
08:08:26 --> 08:08:29
<v MR. INHOFE>devastating effect on our

9253
08:08:29 --> 08:08:32
<v MR. INHOFE>economy and on jobs in america

9254
08:08:32 --> 08:08:33
<v MR. INHOFE>that they will join in and apply

9255
08:08:33 --> 08:08:35
<v MR. INHOFE>the pressure necessary to help

9256
08:08:35 --> 08:08:38
<v MR. INHOFE>the people in this chamber

9257
08:08:38 --> 08:08:40
<v MR. INHOFE>understand that we should pass

9258
08:08:40 --> 08:08:42
<v MR. INHOFE>this congressional review act

9259
08:08:42 --> 08:08:44
<v MR. INHOFE>and do away with this particular

9260
08:08:44 --> 08:08:46
<v MR. INHOFE>very harmful regulation that is

9261
08:08:46 --> 08:08:48
<v MR. INHOFE>before us.

9262
08:08:48 --> 08:08:50
<v MR. INHOFE>You know, I've often said that

9263
08:08:50 --> 08:08:51
<v MR. INHOFE>when you look at -- a lot of

9264
08:08:51 --> 08:08:52
<v MR. INHOFE>people don't understand this,

9265
08:08:52 --> 08:08:55
<v MR. INHOFE>but presidents are the ones who

9266
08:08:55 --> 08:08:56
<v MR. INHOFE>put the budgets down every year.

9267
08:08:56 --> 08:08:57
<v MR. INHOFE>A lot of times they try to blame

9268
08:08:57 --> 08:08:58
<v MR. INHOFE>the house or the senate or the

9269
08:08:58 --> 08:08:59
<v MR. INHOFE>democrats or the republicans.

9270
08:08:59 --> 08:09:01
<v MR. INHOFE>No.

9271
08:09:01 --> 08:09:01
<v MR. INHOFE>It doesn't matter who's in the

9272
08:09:01 --> 08:09:03
<v MR. INHOFE>white house.

9273
08:09:03 --> 08:09:05
<v MR. INHOFE>They are the ones who determine

9274
08:09:05 --> 08:09:07
<v MR. INHOFE>what the budget is.

9275
08:09:07 --> 08:09:10
<v MR. INHOFE>And the -- during the bush

9276
08:09:10 --> 08:09:11
<v MR. INHOFE>years, there were a total of

9277
08:09:11 --> 08:09:12
<v MR. INHOFE>$2 trillion of deficits in eight

9278
08:09:12 --> 08:09:13
<v MR. INHOFE>years.

9279
08:09:13 --> 08:09:17
<v MR. INHOFE>However, after this budget came

9280
08:09:17 --> 08:09:19
<v MR. INHOFE>out just last week, in the obama

9281
08:09:19 --> 08:09:23
<v MR. INHOFE>four years, the -- the -- the

9282
08:09:23 --> 08:09:24
<v MR. INHOFE>increase has been, in deficits,

9283
08:09:24 --> 08:09:25
<v MR. INHOFE>$5.3 trillion.

9284
08:09:25 --> 08:09:27
<v MR. INHOFE>That's $5.3 trillion in four

9285
08:09:27 --> 08:09:28
<v MR. INHOFE>years as opposed to $2 trillion

9286
08:09:28 --> 08:09:31
<v MR. INHOFE>in eight years.

9287
08:09:31 --> 08:09:33
<v MR. INHOFE>Now, as bad as that is, I

9288
08:09:33 --> 08:09:34
<v MR. INHOFE>contend that the regulations of

9289
08:09:34 --> 08:09:36
<v MR. INHOFE>this administration are actually

9290
08:09:36 --> 08:09:38
<v MR. INHOFE>more expensive to the american

9291
08:09:38 --> 08:09:39
<v MR. INHOFE>people than servicing this debt.

9292
08:09:39 --> 08:09:41
<v MR. INHOFE>and so I think it's important

9293
08:09:41 --> 08:09:43
<v MR. INHOFE>that we talk about this, we talk

9294
08:09:43 --> 08:09:44
<v MR. INHOFE>about not just utility mact but

9295
08:09:44 --> 08:09:45
<v MR. INHOFE>all of these.

9296
08:09:45 --> 08:09:48
<v MR. INHOFE>Utility mact is where we should

9297
08:09:48 --> 08:09:49
<v MR. INHOFE>draw the line, however, because

9298
08:09:49 --> 08:09:53
<v MR. INHOFE>that's one that directly affects

9299
08:09:53 --> 08:09:55
<v MR. INHOFE>our ability to -- to provide

9300
08:09:55 --> 08:09:56
<v MR. INHOFE>energy for america, for our

9301
08:09:56 --> 08:09:57
<v MR. INHOFE>manufacturing jobs.

9302
08:09:57 --> 08:10:00
<v MR. INHOFE>We are right now just a little

9303
08:10:00 --> 08:10:03
<v MR. INHOFE>bit under 50% dependent upon

9304
08:10:03 --> 08:10:03
<v MR. INHOFE>coal for our ability to run this

9305
08:10:03 --> 08:10:07
<v MR. INHOFE>machine called america.

9306
08:10:07 --> 08:10:08
<v MR. INHOFE>If you do this, we would lose,

9307
08:10:08 --> 08:10:10
<v MR. INHOFE>it's anticipated we would lose

9308
08:10:10 --> 08:10:14
<v MR. INHOFE>20% of our generation capacity

9309
08:10:14 --> 08:10:15
<v MR. INHOFE>and that translates into air --

9310
08:10:15 --> 08:10:16
<v MR. INHOFE>into a lot of money, as I've

9311
08:10:16 --> 08:10:17
<v MR. INHOFE>just talked about.

9312
08:10:17 --> 08:10:19
<v MR. INHOFE>That's what we've introduced

9313
08:10:19 --> 08:10:20
<v MR. INHOFE>today and I encourage my

9314
08:10:20 --> 08:10:21
<v MR. INHOFE>democrat and republican

9315
08:10:21 --> 08:10:23
<v MR. INHOFE>colleagues to join us in passing

9316
08:10:23 --> 08:10:25
<v MR. INHOFE>this C.R.A.

9317
08:10:25 --> 08:10:27
<v MR. INHOFE>I yield the floor and suggest

9318
08:10:27 --> 08:10:28
<v MR. INHOFE>the absence of a quorum.

9319
08:10:27 --> 08:10:32
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the clerk

9320
08:10:32 --> 08:10:32
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>will call the roll.

9321
08:23:05 --> 08:23:06
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

9322
08:23:06 --> 08:23:07
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senator from oregon.

9323
08:23:07 --> 08:23:08
<v MR. WYDEN>I would ask

9324
08:23:08 --> 08:23:09
<v MR. WYDEN>unanimous consent to vacate the

9325
08:23:10 --> 08:23:10
<v MR. WYDEN>quorum call, Mr. President.

9326
08:23:10 --> 08:23:11
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

9327
08:23:11 --> 08:23:11
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

9328
08:23:12 --> 08:23:12
<v MR. WYDEN>Mr. President, I

9329
08:23:12 --> 08:23:16
<v MR. WYDEN>would ask unanimous consent to

9330
08:23:16 --> 08:23:17
<v MR. WYDEN>speak as if in morning business

9331
08:23:17 --> 08:23:20
<v MR. WYDEN>and would also ask unanimous

9332
08:23:20 --> 08:23:23
<v MR. WYDEN>consent that following my

9333
08:23:23 --> 08:23:25
<v MR. WYDEN>remarks, my colleague in this

9334
08:23:25 --> 08:23:26
<v MR. WYDEN>effort to fund transportation

9335
08:23:26 --> 08:23:27
<v MR. WYDEN>projects, senator hoeven, could

9336
08:23:27 --> 08:23:28
<v MR. WYDEN>follow after me.

9337
08:23:28 --> 08:23:29
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

9338
08:23:29 --> 08:23:30
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

9339
08:23:32 --> 08:23:34
<v MR. WYDEN>Mr. President, we

9340
08:23:34 --> 08:23:37
<v MR. WYDEN>all understand that our country

9341
08:23:37 --> 08:23:39
<v MR. WYDEN>faces an array of major economic

9342
08:23:39 --> 08:23:41
<v MR. WYDEN>challenges, and I made the

9343
08:23:41 --> 08:23:46
<v MR. WYDEN>judgment quite some time ago

9344
08:23:46 --> 08:23:47
<v MR. WYDEN>that it was simply impossible to

9345
08:23:47 --> 08:23:49
<v MR. WYDEN>have big-league economic dproaj

9346
08:23:49 --> 08:23:51
<v MR. WYDEN>with little-league

9347
08:23:51 --> 08:23:53
<v MR. WYDEN>transportation systems, and all

9348
08:23:53 --> 08:23:54
<v MR. WYDEN>across the country -- I know the

9349
08:23:54 --> 08:23:56
<v MR. WYDEN>distinguished President Of the

9350
08:23:56 --> 08:23:59
<v MR. WYDEN>senate has seen in minnesota

9351
08:23:59 --> 08:24:01
<v MR. WYDEN>where he's been doing good work

9352
08:24:01 --> 08:24:02
<v MR. WYDEN>on his infrastructure and

9353
08:24:02 --> 08:24:05
<v MR. WYDEN>bridges, has seen this -- and

9354
08:24:05 --> 08:24:05
<v MR. WYDEN>we've seen this every corner.

9355
08:24:05 --> 08:24:07
<v MR. WYDEN>Land.

9356
08:24:07 --> 08:24:08
<v MR. WYDEN>An and the senator from north

9357
08:24:08 --> 08:24:10
<v MR. WYDEN>dakota when he came to the

9358
08:24:10 --> 08:24:12
<v MR. WYDEN>senate, I had the good fortune

9359
08:24:12 --> 08:24:14
<v MR. WYDEN>to begin to have discussions

9360
08:24:14 --> 08:24:16
<v MR. WYDEN>with him with respect to some

9361
08:24:16 --> 08:24:20
<v MR. WYDEN>new ways to address the question

9362
08:24:20 --> 08:24:21
<v MR. WYDEN>of how to generate funds for the

9363
08:24:21 --> 08:24:23
<v MR. WYDEN>critical transportation work

9364
08:24:24 --> 08:24:26
<v MR. WYDEN>that needs to be done and to

9365
08:24:26 --> 08:24:28
<v MR. WYDEN>generate those funds in a

9366
08:24:28 --> 08:24:30
<v MR. WYDEN>fashion that would be acceptable

9367
08:24:30 --> 08:24:32
<v MR. WYDEN>to the american people.

9368
08:24:32 --> 08:24:34
<v MR. WYDEN>I think we all understand that

9369
08:24:34 --> 08:24:37
<v MR. WYDEN>with this kind of economy and

9370
08:24:37 --> 08:24:39
<v MR. WYDEN>skyrocketing gasoline prices, it

9371
08:24:39 --> 08:24:41
<v MR. WYDEN>is not very likely that folks

9372
08:24:41 --> 08:24:44
<v MR. WYDEN>will be marching outside our

9373
08:24:44 --> 08:24:45
<v MR. WYDEN>matter is offices anytime soon

9374
08:24:45 --> 08:24:48
<v MR. WYDEN>carrying signs saying, &quot;senator,

9375
08:24:48 --> 08:24:50
<v MR. WYDEN>please raise the gas tax.

9376
08:24:50 --> 08:24:52
<v MR. WYDEN>Please raise the tax gas for me,

9377
08:24:52 --> 08:24:54
<v MR. WYDEN>senator, that's what I hope you

9378
08:24:54 --> 08:24:57
<v MR. WYDEN>will spend your time doing.&quot;

9379
08:24:57 --> 08:24:59
<v MR. WYDEN>and so, we have this challenge,

9380
08:24:59 --> 08:25:02
<v MR. WYDEN>given the fact that the

9381
08:25:02 --> 08:25:06
<v MR. WYDEN>traditional system of funding

9382
08:25:06 --> 08:25:08
<v MR. WYDEN>transportation -- user fees.

9383
08:25:08 --> 08:25:11
<v MR. WYDEN>Of course in a tough economy it

9384
08:25:11 --> 08:25:12
<v MR. WYDEN>is going to see that is

9385
08:25:12 --> 08:25:14
<v MR. WYDEN>that as a route

9386
08:25:14 --> 08:25:15
<v MR. WYDEN>to generate funds.

9387
08:25:15 --> 08:25:18
<v MR. WYDEN>For so

9388
08:25:18 --> 08:25:20
<v MR. WYDEN>sometime I have been trying

9389
08:25:20 --> 08:25:20
<v MR. WYDEN>to find a way to secure the

9390
08:25:20 --> 08:25:23
<v MR. WYDEN>possibility of getting

9391
08:25:23 --> 08:25:24
<v MR. WYDEN>additional funds through

9392
08:25:24 --> 08:25:28
<v MR. WYDEN>transportation bonds.

9393
08:25:28 --> 08:25:29
<v MR. WYDEN>They of course have been used at

9394
08:25:29 --> 08:25:31
<v MR. WYDEN>a variety of levels of

9395
08:25:31 --> 08:25:34
<v MR. WYDEN>government, particularly state

9396
08:25:34 --> 08:25:37
<v MR. WYDEN>and local, over the years, and

9397
08:25:37 --> 08:25:39
<v MR. WYDEN>about eight years ago I put

9398
08:25:39 --> 08:25:41
<v MR. WYDEN>forward the first proposal for

9399
08:25:41 --> 08:25:42
<v MR. WYDEN>looking at paying for

9400
08:25:42 --> 08:25:46
<v MR. WYDEN>transportation projects.

9401
08:25:46 --> 08:25:47
<v MR. WYDEN>then with our former colleague

9402
08:25:47 --> 08:25:48
<v MR. WYDEN>senator tim talent, republican

9403
08:25:48 --> 08:25:50
<v MR. WYDEN>from missouri.

9404
08:25:50 --> 08:25:51
<v MR. WYDEN>And we called them &quot;build

9405
08:25:51 --> 08:25:54
<v MR. WYDEN>america bonds.&quot;

9406
08:25:54 --> 08:25:55
<v MR. WYDEN>and senator talent and I thought

9407
08:25:55 --> 08:25:57
<v MR. WYDEN>at that time that this was an

9408
08:25:57 --> 08:26:00
<v MR. WYDEN>opportunity to come up with a

9409
08:26:00 --> 08:26:05
<v MR. WYDEN>fresh and attractive way to pay

9410
08:26:05 --> 08:26:05
<v MR. WYDEN>for transportation projectsment projects --

9411
08:26:05 --> 08:26:07
<v MR. WYDEN>projects.

9412
08:26:07 --> 08:26:11
<v MR. WYDEN>We sought to work with the

9413
08:26:11 --> 08:26:12
<v MR. WYDEN>private sector to find a way to

9414
08:26:12 --> 08:26:14
<v MR. WYDEN>work with federal projected

9415
08:26:14 --> 08:26:15
<v MR. WYDEN>bonding and over the year,

9416
08:26:15 --> 08:26:16
<v MR. WYDEN>senator talent and I were able

9417
08:26:16 --> 08:26:17
<v MR. WYDEN>to attract a number of

9418
08:26:17 --> 08:26:19
<v MR. WYDEN>colleagues on both sides of the

9419
08:26:19 --> 08:26:22
<v MR. WYDEN>aisle for this cause.

9420
08:26:22 --> 08:26:24
<v MR. WYDEN>To give an idea of just how

9421
08:26:24 --> 08:26:26
<v MR. WYDEN>bipartisan this effort has been

9422
08:26:26 --> 08:26:29
<v MR. WYDEN>over the years, senator thune,

9423
08:26:29 --> 08:26:30
<v MR. WYDEN>senator vitter, our former

9424
08:26:30 --> 08:26:33
<v MR. WYDEN>colleague elizabeth dole,

9425
08:26:33 --> 08:26:35
<v MR. WYDEN>senator collins, senator wicker,

9426
08:26:35 --> 08:26:36
<v MR. WYDEN>our former colleague, senator

9427
08:26:36 --> 08:26:38
<v MR. WYDEN>coleman, just a few on the

9428
08:26:38 --> 08:26:40
<v MR. WYDEN>republican side who were part of

9429
08:26:40 --> 08:26:42
<v MR. WYDEN>the effort, and on the

9430
08:26:42 --> 08:26:43
<v MR. WYDEN>democratic side, senator

9431
08:26:43 --> 08:26:45
<v MR. WYDEN>klobuchar, former colleague

9432
08:26:45 --> 08:26:47
<v MR. WYDEN>senator dayton, senator cardin,

9433
08:26:47 --> 08:26:48
<v MR. WYDEN>and senator rockefeller have

9434
08:26:48 --> 08:26:50
<v MR. WYDEN>been just a few who have

9435
08:26:50 --> 08:26:52
<v MR. WYDEN>supported the bonding effort.

9436
08:26:52 --> 08:26:56
<v MR. WYDEN>So in 2009, Mr. President, the

9437
08:26:56 --> 08:26:59
<v MR. WYDEN>congress decided to test out a

9438
08:26:59 --> 08:27:01
<v MR. WYDEN>version of &quot;build america bonds&quot;

9439
08:27:01 --> 08:27:02
<v MR. WYDEN>and in effect as a member of the

9440
08:27:02 --> 08:27:05
<v MR. WYDEN>senate finance committee I have

9441
08:27:05 --> 08:27:07
<v MR. WYDEN>brought it up so many time, I

9442
08:27:07 --> 08:27:09
<v MR. WYDEN>think, with Chairman Baucus and

9443
08:27:09 --> 08:27:11
<v MR. WYDEN>senator grassley -- who was then

9444
08:27:11 --> 08:27:12
<v MR. WYDEN>the ranking member -- I think

9445
08:27:12 --> 08:27:16
<v MR. WYDEN>the two of them said, well,

9446
08:27:16 --> 08:27:17
<v MR. WYDEN>let's just give this a try.

9447
08:27:17 --> 08:27:19
<v MR. WYDEN>The fellow has talked so much

9448
08:27:19 --> 08:27:21
<v MR. WYDEN>about it let's just give this a

9449
08:27:21 --> 08:27:24
<v MR. WYDEN>try as part of the recovery act,

9450
08:27:24 --> 08:27:28
<v MR. WYDEN>and it would in effect go from

9451
08:27:28 --> 08:27:29
<v MR. WYDEN>the middle of 2009 until the end

9452
08:27:29 --> 08:27:31
<v MR. WYDEN>of 2010.

9453
08:27:31 --> 08:27:33
<v MR. WYDEN>And late in the evening, as

9454
08:27:33 --> 08:27:34
<v MR. WYDEN>Chairman Baucus and senator

9455
08:27:34 --> 08:27:36
<v MR. WYDEN>grassley were working to put

9456
08:27:36 --> 08:27:39
<v MR. WYDEN>together the details on the

9457
08:27:39 --> 08:27:42
<v MR. WYDEN>recovery act, I was asked what I

9458
08:27:42 --> 08:27:44
<v MR. WYDEN>thought might be the results of

9459
08:27:44 --> 08:27:46
<v MR. WYDEN>the build america bonds program.

9460
08:27:46 --> 08:27:48
<v MR. WYDEN>and I said, well, it's not going

9461
08:27:48 --> 08:27:51
<v MR. WYDEN>to last all that long.

9462
08:27:51 --> 08:27:52
<v MR. WYDEN>It's going to take the internal

9463
08:27:52 --> 08:27:54
<v MR. WYDEN>revenue service a period of time

9464
08:27:54 --> 08:27:56
<v MR. WYDEN>to put together the rules, and I

9465
08:27:56 --> 08:27:58
<v MR. WYDEN>said, I'm just making this up,

9466
08:27:58 --> 08:28:00
<v MR. WYDEN>but why don't we just estimate

9467
08:28:00 --> 08:28:05
<v MR. WYDEN>that it might generate $6

9468
08:28:05 --> 08:28:05
<v MR. WYDEN>billion to $10 billion worth of

9469
08:28:05 --> 08:28:06
<v MR. WYDEN>transportation and

9470
08:28:06 --> 08:28:08
<v MR. WYDEN>infrastructure investments.

9471
08:28:08 --> 08:28:10
<v MR. WYDEN>And everybody said, experimental

9472
08:28:10 --> 08:28:13
<v MR. WYDEN>program, sounds promg, go

9473
08:28:13 --> 08:28:15
<v MR. WYDEN>program, go

9474
08:28:15 --> 08:28:15
<v MR. WYDEN>ahead, let's give it a try.

9475
08:28:15 --> 08:28:18
<v MR. WYDEN>We

9476
08:28:18 --> 08:28:19
<v MR. WYDEN>well, between April 2009 and the

9477
08:28:19 --> 08:28:23
<v MR. WYDEN>end of the program, at the end

9478
08:28:23 --> 08:28:26
<v MR. WYDEN>of the 2010, there were more

9479
08:28:26 --> 08:28:27
<v MR. WYDEN>than $181 billion worth of build

9480
08:28:27 --> 08:28:31
<v MR. WYDEN>america bonds issued.

9481
08:28:31 --> 08:28:34
<v MR. WYDEN>Just a little bit more than 18

9482
08:28:34 --> 08:28:35
<v MR. WYDEN>times what was predicted.

9483
08:28:35 --> 08:28:37
<v MR. WYDEN>And you often don't have this

9484
08:28:37 --> 08:28:40
<v MR. WYDEN>kind of chacialtion

9485
08:28:40 --> 08:28:41
<v MR. WYDEN>challenge, but in effect

9486
08:28:41 --> 08:28:43
<v MR. WYDEN>one of the issues we had to deal

9487
08:28:43 --> 08:28:44
<v MR. WYDEN>with is build america bonds

9488
08:28:44 --> 08:28:46
<v MR. WYDEN>became so popular that there was

9489
08:28:46 --> 08:28:48
<v MR. WYDEN>an effort to use them for a

9490
08:28:48 --> 08:28:51
<v MR. WYDEN>variety of other projects, many

9491
08:28:51 --> 08:28:53
<v MR. WYDEN>of them very laudable, but they

9492
08:28:53 --> 08:28:55
<v MR. WYDEN>weren't projects that faulked

9493
08:28:55 --> 08:28:55
<v MR. WYDEN>specifically -- that focused

9494
08:28:55 --> 08:28:59
<v MR. WYDEN>spskly

9495
08:28:59 --> 08:29:00
<v MR. WYDEN>specifically on transportation

9496
08:29:00 --> 08:29:01
<v MR. WYDEN>and of course that was the

9497
08:29:01 --> 08:29:03
<v MR. WYDEN>original intent.

9498
08:29:03 --> 08:29:04
<v MR. WYDEN>Also there was no cap on them.

9499
08:29:04 --> 08:29:06
<v MR. WYDEN>Nobody realized that they would

9500
08:29:06 --> 08:29:10
<v MR. WYDEN>be so popular.

9501
08:29:10 --> 08:29:12
<v MR. WYDEN>So there was a concern that this

9502
08:29:12 --> 08:29:17
<v MR. WYDEN>was more than colleagues on both

9503
08:29:17 --> 08:29:17
<v MR. WYDEN>sides of the aisle had bargained

9504
08:29:17 --> 08:29:18
<v MR. WYDEN>for.

9505
08:29:18 --> 08:29:19
<v MR. WYDEN>We do want to note that the

9506
08:29:19 --> 08:29:21
<v MR. WYDEN>treasury department issued their

9507
08:29:21 --> 08:29:23
<v MR. WYDEN>final report on build america

9508
08:29:23 --> 08:29:24
<v MR. WYDEN>bonds earlier this year, and

9509
08:29:24 --> 08:29:28
<v MR. WYDEN>they said that build america

9510
08:29:28 --> 08:29:30
<v MR. WYDEN>bonds issuers saved well over

9511
08:29:30 --> 08:29:32
<v MR. WYDEN>$20 billion in borrowing costs

9512
08:29:32 --> 08:29:33
<v MR. WYDEN>on a present value basis as

9513
08:29:33 --> 08:29:36
<v MR. WYDEN>compared to tax-exempt bonds.

9514
08:29:36 --> 08:29:38
<v MR. WYDEN>So, clearly, there was something

9515
08:29:39 --> 08:29:42
<v MR. WYDEN>to work with in terms of trying

9516
08:29:42 --> 08:29:44
<v MR. WYDEN>to take the next steps.

9517
08:29:44 --> 08:29:46
<v MR. WYDEN>And with my colleague from north

9518
08:29:46 --> 08:29:49
<v MR. WYDEN>dakota coming to the senate,

9519
08:29:49 --> 08:29:50
<v MR. WYDEN>when he arrived here, I said, it

9520
08:29:50 --> 08:29:53
<v MR. WYDEN>would be great to have an

9521
08:29:53 --> 08:29:55
<v MR. WYDEN>opportunity to work with a

9522
08:29:55 --> 08:29:58
<v MR. WYDEN>partner and to look specifically

9523
08:29:58 --> 08:30:02
<v MR. WYDEN>at trying to rebuild the concept

9524
08:30:02 --> 08:30:04
<v MR. WYDEN>of focusing specifically on

9525
08:30:04 --> 08:30:06
<v MR. WYDEN>transportation in a way that

9526
08:30:06 --> 08:30:08
<v MR. WYDEN>would generate a substantial

9527
08:30:08 --> 08:30:10
<v MR. WYDEN>amount of new revenue and would

9528
08:30:10 --> 08:30:12
<v MR. WYDEN>be acceptable to colleagues

9529
08:30:12 --> 08:30:15
<v MR. WYDEN>across the political spectrum

9530
08:30:15 --> 08:30:15
<v MR. WYDEN>and those who follow these

9531
08:30:15 --> 08:30:17
<v MR. WYDEN>issues.

9532
08:30:17 --> 08:30:21
<v MR. WYDEN>And as my colleague knows, we

9533
08:30:21 --> 08:30:23
<v MR. WYDEN>have now come up with a new

9534
08:30:23 --> 08:30:26
<v MR. WYDEN>approach called transportation

9535
08:30:26 --> 08:30:26
<v MR. WYDEN>and regional infrastructure

9536
08:30:26 --> 08:30:30
<v MR. WYDEN>bonds.

9537
08:30:30 --> 08:30:31
<v MR. WYDEN>chairman baucus and senator

9538
08:30:31 --> 08:30:32
<v MR. WYDEN>hatch have been good enough to

9539
08:30:32 --> 08:30:35
<v MR. WYDEN>include them in the finance

9540
08:30:35 --> 08:30:37
<v MR. WYDEN>title of this year's

9541
08:30:37 --> 08:30:38
<v MR. WYDEN>transportation funding program,

9542
08:30:38 --> 08:30:42
<v MR. WYDEN>and we wanted to spend just a

9543
08:30:42 --> 08:30:44
<v MR. WYDEN>few minutes to talk a little bit

9544
08:30:44 --> 08:30:44
<v MR. WYDEN>about how these would work.

9545
08:30:44 --> 08:30:47
<v MR. WYDEN>I.

9546
08:30:47 --> 08:30:50
<v MR. WYDEN>I think that given the fact that

9547
08:30:50 --> 08:30:52
<v MR. WYDEN>we've been able to attract a

9548
08:30:52 --> 08:30:53
<v MR. WYDEN>number of folks on the

9549
08:30:53 --> 08:30:55
<v MR. WYDEN>progressive side of the

9550
08:30:55 --> 08:30:59
<v MR. WYDEN>political spectrum, folks in

9551
08:30:59 --> 08:31:00
<v MR. WYDEN>labor, for example, doug holds

9552
08:31:00 --> 08:31:03
<v MR. WYDEN>eakin has issued a very helpful

9553
08:31:03 --> 08:31:04
<v MR. WYDEN>paper that I hope will also

9554
08:31:04 --> 08:31:04
<v MR. WYDEN>bring conservatives to this

9555
08:31:04 --> 08:31:05
<v MR. WYDEN>cause.

9556
08:31:05 --> 08:31:07
<v MR. WYDEN>We've shared that paper with

9557
08:31:07 --> 08:31:10
<v MR. WYDEN>colleagues on both sides of the

9558
08:31:10 --> 08:31:13
<v MR. WYDEN>aisle.

9559
08:31:13 --> 08:31:15
<v MR. WYDEN>And the way that trips bonds

9560
08:31:15 --> 08:31:17
<v MR. WYDEN>would work is first they're tax

9561
08:31:17 --> 08:31:18
<v MR. WYDEN>credit bonds created

9562
08:31:19 --> 08:31:19
<v MR. WYDEN>specifically for transportation

9563
08:31:19 --> 08:31:20
<v MR. WYDEN>projects.

9564
08:31:20 --> 08:31:23
<v MR. WYDEN>We would allow infrastructure

9565
08:31:23 --> 08:31:26
<v MR. WYDEN>banks that already exist in

9566
08:31:26 --> 08:31:27
<v MR. WYDEN>nearly every state to issue

9567
08:31:27 --> 08:31:30
<v MR. WYDEN>these bonds.

9568
08:31:30 --> 08:31:34
<v MR. WYDEN>this time we look to really

9569
08:31:34 --> 08:31:36
<v MR. WYDEN>focus on the states, the states

9570
08:31:36 --> 08:31:37
<v MR. WYDEN>as the primary vehicle for

9571
08:31:37 --> 08:31:39
<v MR. WYDEN>ensuring that these projects

9572
08:31:39 --> 08:31:43
<v MR. WYDEN>would have local support and

9573
08:31:43 --> 08:31:46
<v MR. WYDEN>would really meet long-term

9574
08:31:46 --> 08:31:46
<v MR. WYDEN>needs that the states have

9575
08:31:46 --> 08:31:49
<v MR. WYDEN>identified.

9576
08:31:50 --> 08:31:55
<v MR. WYDEN>and we would pay for the bonds

9577
08:31:55 --> 08:31:57
<v MR. WYDEN>with a sinking fund kpraoeuplsed

9578
08:31:57 --> 08:32:00
<v MR. WYDEN>of -- comprised of state

9579
08:32:00 --> 08:32:01
<v MR. WYDEN>matching contributions and

9580
08:32:01 --> 08:32:03
<v MR. WYDEN>customs user fees.

9581
08:32:03 --> 08:32:05
<v MR. WYDEN>In the proposal submitted by the

9582
08:32:05 --> 08:32:07
<v MR. WYDEN>finance committee we would cap

9583
08:32:07 --> 08:32:09
<v MR. WYDEN>the total amount of bonds at $50

9584
08:32:09 --> 08:32:10
<v MR. WYDEN>million giving each state 2% of

9585
08:32:10 --> 08:32:11
<v MR. WYDEN>the total.

9586
08:32:11 --> 08:32:13
<v MR. WYDEN>In effect what the finance

9587
08:32:13 --> 08:32:15
<v MR. WYDEN>committee has done is put a

9588
08:32:15 --> 08:32:18
<v MR. WYDEN>place holder in their bill for

9589
08:32:18 --> 08:32:18
<v MR. WYDEN>us to go forward with this

9590
08:32:18 --> 08:32:20
<v MR. WYDEN>effort.

9591
08:32:20 --> 08:32:22
<v MR. WYDEN>Each state would get at least $1

9592
08:32:23 --> 08:32:24
<v MR. WYDEN>billion in bonds to issue on

9593
08:32:24 --> 08:32:26
<v MR. WYDEN>projects at their discretion.

9594
08:32:26 --> 08:32:30
<v MR. WYDEN>States can also band together to

9595
08:32:30 --> 08:32:32
<v MR. WYDEN>bond for larger projects or ones

9596
08:32:32 --> 08:32:34
<v MR. WYDEN>that would have the benefit of

9597
08:32:34 --> 08:32:35
<v MR. WYDEN>addressing the concern of states

9598
08:32:35 --> 08:32:37
<v MR. WYDEN>in a region.

9599
08:32:37 --> 08:32:38
<v MR. WYDEN>This would give the states the

9600
08:32:38 --> 08:32:40
<v MR. WYDEN>incentive and the ability to

9601
08:32:40 --> 08:32:41
<v MR. WYDEN>invest in their own

9602
08:32:41 --> 08:32:43
<v MR. WYDEN>transportation and does so in a

9603
08:32:43 --> 08:32:45
<v MR. WYDEN>way that leverages private

9604
08:32:45 --> 08:32:47
<v MR. WYDEN>investments and costs little to

9605
08:32:47 --> 08:32:50
<v MR. WYDEN>our government in lost revenue.

9606
08:32:50 --> 08:32:51
<v MR. WYDEN>We would give private investors

9607
08:32:51 --> 08:32:56
<v MR. WYDEN>who show a willingness to help

9608
08:32:56 --> 08:32:58
<v MR. WYDEN>build our roads and bridges and

9609
08:32:58 --> 08:33:00
<v MR. WYDEN>rail systems, a tax credit for

9610
08:33:00 --> 08:33:02
<v MR. WYDEN>their commitment.

9611
08:33:02 --> 08:33:04
<v MR. WYDEN>And what build america bonds

9612
08:33:04 --> 08:33:05
<v MR. WYDEN>taught us is there is a real

9613
08:33:05 --> 08:33:08
<v MR. WYDEN>market out there.

9614
08:33:08 --> 08:33:11
<v MR. WYDEN>And what we'd like to do is look

9615
08:33:11 --> 08:33:13
<v MR. WYDEN>at a different approach now,

9616
08:33:13 --> 08:33:15
<v MR. WYDEN>focusing on the states, focusing

9617
08:33:15 --> 08:33:18
<v MR. WYDEN>on an approach that would really

9618
08:33:18 --> 08:33:22
<v MR. WYDEN>drive these projects not in

9619
08:33:22 --> 08:33:23
<v MR. WYDEN>washington, D.C. At a, but at a

9620
08:33:23 --> 08:33:26
<v MR. WYDEN>local level.

9621
08:33:26 --> 08:33:27
<v MR. WYDEN>The joint committee on taxation

9622
08:33:27 --> 08:33:30
<v MR. WYDEN>has told us this is an approach

9623
08:33:30 --> 08:33:32
<v MR. WYDEN>that would produce a

9624
08:33:32 --> 08:33:33
<v MR. WYDEN>particularly good deal for

9625
08:33:33 --> 08:33:36
<v MR. WYDEN>american taxpayers.

9626
08:33:37 --> 08:33:38
<v MR. WYDEN>We can get a transportation bill

9627
08:33:38 --> 08:33:40
<v MR. WYDEN>done, Mr. President.

9628
08:33:40 --> 08:33:42
<v MR. WYDEN>We can put folks back to work.

9629
08:33:42 --> 08:33:46
<v MR. WYDEN>But we're going to have to find

9630
08:33:46 --> 08:33:49
<v MR. WYDEN>a way to come up with more

9631
08:33:49 --> 08:33:50
<v MR. WYDEN>creative approaches to generate

9632
08:33:50 --> 08:33:52
<v MR. WYDEN>additional revenue.

9633
08:33:52 --> 08:33:55
<v MR. WYDEN>if we don't, I think we are

9634
08:33:55 --> 08:33:57
<v MR. WYDEN>going to continue to see in

9635
08:33:57 --> 08:34:01
<v MR. WYDEN>every corner of the country

9636
08:34:01 --> 08:34:03
<v MR. WYDEN>critically needed projects

9637
08:34:03 --> 08:34:05
<v MR. WYDEN>simply go unaddressed.

9638
08:34:05 --> 08:34:07
<v MR. WYDEN>We're going to continue to see

9639
08:34:07 --> 08:34:09
<v MR. WYDEN>traffic jams in areas of the

9640
08:34:09 --> 08:34:11
<v MR. WYDEN>country nobody could have even

9641
08:34:11 --> 08:34:11
<v MR. WYDEN>dreamed a traffic jam would be

9642
08:34:11 --> 08:34:14
<v MR. WYDEN>in.

9643
08:34:14 --> 08:34:17
<v MR. WYDEN>and I hope that senators, as we

9644
08:34:17 --> 08:34:19
<v MR. WYDEN>go forward with this debate,

9645
08:34:19 --> 08:34:22
<v MR. WYDEN>particularly after the

9646
08:34:22 --> 08:34:24
<v MR. WYDEN>President's day break, will join

9647
08:34:24 --> 08:34:27
<v MR. WYDEN>my colleague.

9648
08:34:27 --> 08:34:29
<v MR. WYDEN>Senator begich has been very

9649
08:34:29 --> 08:34:29
<v MR. WYDEN>supportive of this approach as

9650
08:34:29 --> 08:34:30
<v MR. WYDEN>well.

9651
08:34:30 --> 08:34:32
<v MR. WYDEN>We think this is an approach

9652
08:34:32 --> 08:34:34
<v MR. WYDEN>with a proven tack record, given

9653
08:34:34 --> 08:34:36
<v MR. WYDEN>what we saw -- proven track

9654
08:34:36 --> 08:34:37
<v MR. WYDEN>record given what we saw with

9655
08:34:37 --> 08:34:38
<v MR. WYDEN>build america bonds.

9656
08:34:38 --> 08:34:41
<v MR. WYDEN>And we believe this is a chance

9657
08:34:41 --> 08:34:43
<v MR. WYDEN>to take the lessons that we

9658
08:34:43 --> 08:34:46
<v MR. WYDEN>learned from that experience and

9659
08:34:46 --> 08:34:49
<v MR. WYDEN>by changing the focus so that it

9660
08:34:49 --> 08:34:51
<v MR. WYDEN>zeros in more directly, one, on

9661
08:34:51 --> 08:34:53
<v MR. WYDEN>transportation, two, on the

9662
08:34:53 --> 08:34:55
<v MR. WYDEN>states and looks to some

9663
08:34:55 --> 08:34:59
<v MR. WYDEN>creative features.

9664
08:34:59 --> 08:35:00
<v MR. WYDEN>It pops possible, for example --

9665
08:35:00 --> 08:35:02
<v MR. WYDEN>it's possible for someone to

9666
08:35:02 --> 08:35:03
<v MR. WYDEN>strip the credit from the

9667
08:35:03 --> 08:35:03
<v MR. WYDEN>underlying bond and to sell the

9668
08:35:03 --> 08:35:06
<v MR. WYDEN>credit.

9669
08:35:06 --> 08:35:07
<v MR. WYDEN>This provides a lot more

9670
08:35:07 --> 08:35:09
<v MR. WYDEN>flexibility in terms of finding

9671
08:35:09 --> 08:35:12
<v MR. WYDEN>a way to get the private sector

9672
08:35:12 --> 08:35:14
<v MR. WYDEN>into the transportation area.

9673
08:35:14 --> 08:35:18
<v MR. WYDEN>i hope my colleagues, when we

9674
08:35:19 --> 08:35:21
<v MR. WYDEN>come back, will be supportive of

9675
08:35:21 --> 08:35:24
<v MR. WYDEN>this effort.

9676
08:35:24 --> 08:35:26
<v MR. WYDEN>It has won, as I've indicated,

9677
08:35:26 --> 08:35:27
<v MR. WYDEN>support across the political

9678
08:35:27 --> 08:35:28
<v MR. WYDEN>spectrum.

9679
08:35:28 --> 08:35:33
<v MR. WYDEN>I want to thank my partner from

9680
08:35:33 --> 08:35:36
<v MR. WYDEN>the state of north dakota.

9681
08:35:36 --> 08:35:37
<v MR. WYDEN>i very much enjoyed work with

9682
08:35:37 --> 08:35:38
<v MR. WYDEN>him both on the energy committee

9683
08:35:38 --> 08:35:41
<v MR. WYDEN>and on this issue.

9684
08:35:41 --> 08:35:43
<v MR. WYDEN>As a former governor, I think he

9685
08:35:43 --> 08:35:46
<v MR. WYDEN>understands particularly well

9686
08:35:46 --> 08:35:47
<v MR. WYDEN>the role of the states in terms

9687
08:35:47 --> 08:35:49
<v MR. WYDEN>of infrastructure.

9688
08:35:49 --> 08:35:51
<v MR. WYDEN>We'll be talking to colleagues

9689
08:35:51 --> 08:35:53
<v MR. WYDEN>between now and the time the

9690
08:35:53 --> 08:35:55
<v MR. WYDEN>transportation bill comes up.

9691
08:35:55 --> 08:35:56
<v MR. WYDEN>and I thank my friend from north

9692
08:35:56 --> 08:35:57
<v MR. WYDEN>dakota for his support.

9693
08:35:57 --> 08:35:59
<v MR. WYDEN>Mr. President, with that I yield

9694
08:35:59 --> 08:36:00
<v MR. WYDEN>the floor.

9695
08:36:00 --> 08:36:01
<v MR. WYDEN>I'd like to --

9696
08:36:01 --> 08:36:03
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

9697
08:36:03 --> 08:36:03
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senator from north dakota.

9698
08:36:04 --> 08:36:06
<v MR. HOEVEN>Mr. President, I'd

9699
08:36:06 --> 08:36:07
<v MR. HOEVEN>like to thank my esteemed

9700
08:36:07 --> 08:36:09
<v MR. HOEVEN>colleague from the great state

9701
08:36:09 --> 08:36:10
<v MR. HOEVEN>of oregon, senator wyden, for

9702
08:36:10 --> 08:36:12
<v MR. HOEVEN>his leadership on this important

9703
08:36:12 --> 08:36:13
<v MR. HOEVEN>issue, for his work on the

9704
08:36:13 --> 08:36:16
<v MR. HOEVEN>highway bill.

9705
08:36:16 --> 08:36:19
<v MR. HOEVEN>and specifically, for his work

9706
08:36:19 --> 08:36:21
<v MR. HOEVEN>on the trips bond.

9707
08:36:21 --> 08:36:22
<v MR. HOEVEN>Transportation regional

9708
08:36:22 --> 08:36:23
<v MR. HOEVEN>infrastructure projects bonds.

9709
08:36:23 --> 08:36:26
<v MR. HOEVEN>It is a creative concept and I

9710
08:36:26 --> 08:36:28
<v MR. HOEVEN>think it's very, very timely.

9711
08:36:28 --> 08:36:29
<v MR. HOEVEN>Senator wyden approached me and

9712
08:36:29 --> 08:36:32
<v MR. HOEVEN>said, you know, as we're working

9713
08:36:32 --> 08:36:34
<v MR. HOEVEN>on this highway bill, can we

9714
08:36:34 --> 08:36:37
<v MR. HOEVEN>work together on this concept of

9715
08:36:37 --> 08:36:38
<v MR. HOEVEN>something like a trips bond

9716
08:36:38 --> 08:36:40
<v MR. HOEVEN>concept?

9717
08:36:40 --> 08:36:42
<v MR. HOEVEN>And I expressed my appreciation

9718
08:36:42 --> 08:36:46
<v MR. HOEVEN>for his creativity and the offer

9719
08:36:46 --> 08:36:48
<v MR. HOEVEN>to work together and said that,

9720
08:36:48 --> 08:36:49
<v MR. HOEVEN>one, I absolutely wanted to do

9721
08:36:49 --> 08:36:50
<v MR. HOEVEN>it because it's so important to

9722
08:36:50 --> 08:36:53
<v MR. HOEVEN>our country right now.

9723
08:36:53 --> 08:36:53
<v MR. HOEVEN>We need the jobs, we need the

9724
08:36:53 --> 08:36:55
<v MR. HOEVEN>economic activity.

9725
08:36:55 --> 08:36:57
<v MR. HOEVEN>we need the infrastructure.

9726
08:36:57 --> 08:36:58
<v MR. HOEVEN>That's khraoefrplt as the --

9727
08:36:58 --> 08:37:01
<v MR. HOEVEN>that's clear.

9728
08:37:01 --> 08:37:03
<v MR. HOEVEN>As the good senator said, we've

9729
08:37:03 --> 08:37:04
<v MR. HOEVEN>got to be creative in figuring

9730
08:37:04 --> 08:37:07
<v MR. HOEVEN>out how to do this.

9731
08:37:07 --> 08:37:08
<v MR. HOEVEN>We're going to do to do it in

9732
08:37:08 --> 08:37:10
<v MR. HOEVEN>the framework of making sure

9733
08:37:10 --> 08:37:14
<v MR. HOEVEN>it's paid for and making sure it

9734
08:37:14 --> 08:37:15
<v MR. HOEVEN>doesn't affect the deficit or

9735
08:37:15 --> 08:37:17
<v MR. HOEVEN>debt.

9736
08:37:17 --> 08:37:19
<v MR. HOEVEN>0 so we went to work on it, and

9737
08:37:19 --> 08:37:20
<v MR. HOEVEN>I want to thank him for taking

9738
08:37:20 --> 08:37:22
<v MR. HOEVEN>the initiative and for all the

9739
08:37:22 --> 08:37:23
<v MR. HOEVEN>work he and his staff have put

9740
08:37:23 --> 08:37:25
<v MR. HOEVEN>into what I think is a very

9741
08:37:25 --> 08:37:27
<v MR. HOEVEN>creative idea and a real

9742
08:37:27 --> 08:37:29
<v MR. HOEVEN>opportunity for us, as I say, in

9743
08:37:29 --> 08:37:31
<v MR. HOEVEN>infrastructure and in job

9744
08:37:31 --> 08:37:32
<v MR. HOEVEN>creation and economic activity

9745
08:37:32 --> 08:37:33
<v MR. HOEVEN>for our country.

9746
08:37:33 --> 08:37:36
<v MR. HOEVEN>I also want to extend my thanks

9747
08:37:36 --> 08:37:39
<v MR. HOEVEN>to two members of the house of

9748
08:37:39 --> 08:37:43
<v MR. HOEVEN>representatives as well.

9749
08:37:43 --> 08:37:45
<v MR. HOEVEN>Both ed whitfield, a congressman

9750
08:37:45 --> 08:37:48
<v MR. HOEVEN>from kentucky, republican.

9751
08:37:48 --> 08:37:50
<v MR. HOEVEN>And congressman leonard boswell,

9752
08:37:50 --> 08:37:52
<v MR. HOEVEN>democrat from the state of iowa.

9753
08:37:52 --> 08:37:53
<v MR. HOEVEN>In both the senate and the

9754
08:37:53 --> 08:37:54
<v MR. HOEVEN>house, this has been a

9755
08:37:54 --> 08:37:55
<v MR. HOEVEN>bipartisan effort.

9756
08:37:55 --> 08:37:59
<v MR. HOEVEN>That's important because at the

9757
08:37:59 --> 08:38:01
<v MR. HOEVEN>end of day if we're going to get

9758
08:38:01 --> 08:38:02
<v MR. HOEVEN>it passed that is what it takes,

9759
08:38:02 --> 08:38:04
<v MR. HOEVEN>bipartisan support.

9760
08:38:04 --> 08:38:05
<v MR. HOEVEN>This is something vitally

9761
08:38:05 --> 08:38:06
<v MR. HOEVEN>important, our infrastructure

9762
08:38:06 --> 08:38:07
<v MR. HOEVEN>needs, job creation.

9763
08:38:07 --> 08:38:08
<v MR. HOEVEN>It is something we pay for so it

9764
08:38:08 --> 08:38:09
<v MR. HOEVEN>doesn't increase the deficit or

9765
08:38:09 --> 08:38:11
<v MR. HOEVEN>the debt.

9766
08:38:12 --> 08:38:14
<v MR. HOEVEN>And it is absolutely bipartisan.

9767
08:38:14 --> 08:38:16
<v MR. HOEVEN>Again, as my esteemed colleague

9768
08:38:16 --> 08:38:18
<v MR. HOEVEN>just mentioned, I bring the

9769
08:38:18 --> 08:38:20
<v MR. HOEVEN>perspective as a governor.

9770
08:38:20 --> 08:38:23
<v MR. HOEVEN>We're talking about $25 billion

9771
08:38:23 --> 08:38:23
<v MR. HOEVEN>in addition to the normal

9772
08:38:23 --> 08:38:27
<v MR. HOEVEN>highway funding.

9773
08:38:27 --> 08:38:28
<v MR. HOEVEN>So this is for projects and

9774
08:38:28 --> 08:38:29
<v MR. HOEVEN>infrastructure that state

9775
08:38:29 --> 08:38:31
<v MR. HOEVEN>departments of transportation

9776
08:38:31 --> 08:38:34
<v MR. HOEVEN>and governors, people at the

9777
08:38:34 --> 08:38:36
<v MR. HOEVEN>state level, at the local level,

9778
08:38:36 --> 08:38:38
<v MR. HOEVEN>they decide what infrastructure

9779
08:38:38 --> 08:38:42
<v MR. HOEVEN>projects need to be done, and

9780
08:38:42 --> 08:38:42
<v MR. HOEVEN>they can then use these funds

9781
08:38:42 --> 08:38:45
<v MR. HOEVEN>accordingly.

9782
08:38:45 --> 08:38:48
<v MR. HOEVEN>That is of tremendous value to

9783
08:38:48 --> 08:38:50
<v MR. HOEVEN>them.

9784
08:38:50 --> 08:38:52
<v MR. HOEVEN>Without, exception, go across

9785
08:38:52 --> 08:38:54
<v MR. HOEVEN>the state, ask any of the

9786
08:38:54 --> 08:38:55
<v MR. HOEVEN>governors or their departments

9787
08:38:55 --> 08:38:56
<v MR. HOEVEN>of transportation, they will

9788
08:38:56 --> 08:38:58
<v MR. HOEVEN>tell you that is exactly the

9789
08:38:58 --> 08:39:00
<v MR. HOEVEN>kind of funding we want and need

9790
08:39:00 --> 08:39:01
<v MR. HOEVEN>to do the very best job for the

9791
08:39:01 --> 08:39:02
<v MR. HOEVEN>people we serve in our

9792
08:39:02 --> 08:39:05
<v MR. HOEVEN>respective states.

9793
08:39:05 --> 08:39:07
<v MR. HOEVEN>$25 billion, $10 billion, the

9794
08:39:07 --> 08:39:07
<v MR. HOEVEN>first year $15 billion in year

9795
08:39:07 --> 08:39:09
<v MR. HOEVEN>two.

9796
08:39:09 --> 08:39:10
<v MR. HOEVEN>That will make an incredible

9797
08:39:10 --> 08:39:12
<v MR. HOEVEN>difference for every single

9798
08:39:12 --> 08:39:16
<v MR. HOEVEN>state in the country.

9799
08:39:16 --> 08:39:18
<v MR. HOEVEN>Now, the other thing to keep in

9800
08:39:18 --> 08:39:21
<v MR. HOEVEN>mind, senator wyden went through

9801
08:39:21 --> 08:39:22
<v MR. HOEVEN>for just a minute how we have

9802
08:39:22 --> 08:39:25
<v MR. HOEVEN>structured the bonds.

9803
08:39:25 --> 08:39:27
<v MR. HOEVEN>Essentially it results in a four

9804
08:39:27 --> 08:39:27
<v MR. HOEVEN>to one leveraging of funds for

9805
08:39:28 --> 08:39:30
<v MR. HOEVEN>every state.

9806
08:39:30 --> 08:39:31
<v MR. HOEVEN>They put their dollars into the

9807
08:39:31 --> 08:39:33
<v MR. HOEVEN>sinking funds.

9808
08:39:33 --> 08:39:35
<v MR. HOEVEN>They select the projects.

9809
08:39:35 --> 08:39:37
<v MR. HOEVEN>On project by project, they put

9810
08:39:37 --> 08:39:40
<v MR. HOEVEN>forward dollars in the sinking

9811
08:39:40 --> 08:39:40
<v MR. HOEVEN>fund and we provide them a 4-1

9812
08:39:40 --> 08:39:43
<v MR. HOEVEN>match.

9813
08:39:43 --> 08:39:47
<v MR. HOEVEN>So, for example, $500 million

9814
08:39:47 --> 08:39:48
<v MR. HOEVEN>goes to a state as they select

9815
08:39:48 --> 08:39:50
<v MR. HOEVEN>projects.

9816
08:39:50 --> 08:39:50
<v MR. HOEVEN>That $500 million funds those

9817
08:39:50 --> 08:39:52
<v MR. HOEVEN>projects.

9818
08:39:52 --> 08:39:54
<v MR. HOEVEN>They put up $100 billion as they

9819
08:39:54 --> 08:39:54
<v MR. HOEVEN>select and advance those

9820
08:39:54 --> 08:39:58
<v MR. HOEVEN>projects.

9821
08:39:58 --> 08:40:05
<v MR. HOEVEN>for their $100 billion, they're

9822
08:40:05 --> 08:40:07
<v MR. HOEVEN>doing -- discuss me, for that

9823
08:40:07 --> 08:40:08
<v MR. HOEVEN>$100 billion they're doing $500

9824
08:40:08 --> 08:40:09
<v MR. HOEVEN>million in projects.

9825
08:40:09 --> 08:40:11
<v MR. HOEVEN>This is what the states are

9826
08:40:11 --> 08:40:12
<v MR. HOEVEN>looking for, exactly what they

9827
08:40:12 --> 08:40:13
<v MR. HOEVEN>need.

9828
08:40:13 --> 08:40:14
<v MR. HOEVEN>I don't know how anyone driving

9829
08:40:14 --> 08:40:16
<v MR. HOEVEN>around the country, whether here

9830
08:40:16 --> 08:40:18
<v MR. HOEVEN>in the district or anywhere

9831
08:40:18 --> 08:40:19
<v MR. HOEVEN>else, they're going to tell you,

9832
08:40:19 --> 08:40:20
<v MR. HOEVEN>look, we have got to address our

9833
08:40:20 --> 08:40:22
<v MR. HOEVEN>infrastructure needs.

9834
08:40:22 --> 08:40:24
<v MR. HOEVEN>And that this is absolutely

9835
08:40:24 --> 08:40:27
<v MR. HOEVEN>something that will make a big

9836
08:40:27 --> 08:40:28
<v MR. HOEVEN>difference in doing that.

9837
08:40:28 --> 08:40:31
<v MR. HOEVEN>Again, in addition to being

9838
08:40:31 --> 08:40:32
<v MR. HOEVEN>truly a bipartisan effort and a

9839
08:40:32 --> 08:40:34
<v MR. HOEVEN>bicameral effort at this point,

9840
08:40:34 --> 08:40:36
<v MR. HOEVEN>we have received tremendous

9841
08:40:36 --> 08:40:38
<v MR. HOEVEN>support and encouragement from

9842
08:40:38 --> 08:40:40
<v MR. HOEVEN>across the country and from

9843
08:40:40 --> 08:40:43
<v MR. HOEVEN>truly a diverse range of groups,

9844
08:40:43 --> 08:40:46
<v MR. HOEVEN>from labor, from business, from

9845
08:40:46 --> 08:40:46
<v MR. HOEVEN>mayors, from county

9846
08:40:46 --> 08:40:48
<v MR. HOEVEN>commissioners.

9847
08:40:48 --> 08:40:50
<v MR. HOEVEN>That truly has not only

9848
08:40:50 --> 08:40:51
<v MR. HOEVEN>bipartisan support but

9849
08:40:51 --> 08:40:52
<v MR. HOEVEN>incredibly strong support across

9850
08:40:52 --> 08:40:53
<v MR. HOEVEN>the country.

9851
08:40:53 --> 08:40:55
<v MR. HOEVEN>Just some of the various groups

9852
08:40:55 --> 08:40:56
<v MR. HOEVEN>that have come out and already

9853
08:40:56 --> 08:40:58
<v MR. HOEVEN>endorsed the project include the

9854
08:40:58 --> 08:41:00
<v MR. HOEVEN>american association of roads

9855
08:41:00 --> 08:41:01
<v MR. HOEVEN>and transportation builders, the

9856
08:41:01 --> 08:41:02
<v MR. HOEVEN>american association of state

9857
08:41:02 --> 08:41:05
<v MR. HOEVEN>highway and transportation

9858
08:41:05 --> 08:41:08
<v MR. HOEVEN>officials, the U.S. Chamber of

9859
08:41:08 --> 08:41:10
<v MR. HOEVEN>commerce, the american highway

9860
08:41:10 --> 08:41:12
<v MR. HOEVEN>users alliance, the associated

9861
08:41:12 --> 08:41:15
<v MR. HOEVEN>general contractors of america,

9862
08:41:15 --> 08:41:17
<v MR. HOEVEN>the international union of

9863
08:41:17 --> 08:41:19
<v MR. HOEVEN>operating engineers, laborers

9864
08:41:19 --> 08:41:20
<v MR. HOEVEN>international, union of north

9865
08:41:20 --> 08:41:22
<v MR. HOEVEN>america.

9866
08:41:22 --> 08:41:23

9867
08:41:23 --> 08:41:24
<v MR. HOEVEN>manufacturers, american society

9868
08:41:24 --> 08:41:26
<v MR. HOEVEN>of civil engineers.

9869
08:41:26 --> 08:41:27
<v MR. HOEVEN>Again, mayors, commissioners.

9870
08:41:27 --> 08:41:31
<v MR. HOEVEN>This truly has broad, strong

9871
08:41:31 --> 08:41:32
<v MR. HOEVEN>support at the grass roots

9872
08:41:32 --> 08:41:34
<v MR. HOEVEN>level.

9873
08:41:34 --> 08:41:36
<v MR. HOEVEN>And that is reflective of the

9874
08:41:36 --> 08:41:38
<v MR. HOEVEN>fact that it is exactly the kind

9875
08:41:38 --> 08:41:39
<v MR. HOEVEN>of project that we need to

9876
08:41:39 --> 08:41:41
<v MR. HOEVEN>advance.

9877
08:41:41 --> 08:41:43
<v MR. HOEVEN>as we work on this highway bill,

9878
08:41:43 --> 08:41:44
<v MR. HOEVEN>I see this as a tremendous

9879
08:41:44 --> 08:41:46
<v MR. HOEVEN>opportunity.

9880
08:41:46 --> 08:41:47
<v MR. HOEVEN>Really an opportunity and not

9881
08:41:47 --> 08:41:50
<v MR. HOEVEN>just in terms of the

9882
08:41:50 --> 08:41:54
<v MR. HOEVEN>infrastructure we so badly need,

9883
08:41:54 --> 08:41:57
<v MR. HOEVEN>but tpo -- to put people to work

9884
08:41:57 --> 08:41:58
<v MR. HOEVEN>in good jobs, good-paying jobs.

9885
08:41:58 --> 08:41:59
<v MR. HOEVEN>Think of the secondary

9886
08:41:59 --> 08:42:01
<v MR. HOEVEN>ramifications that has for our

9887
08:42:01 --> 08:42:03
<v MR. HOEVEN>economy right now.

9888
08:42:03 --> 08:42:04
<v MR. HOEVEN>Incredibly important, makes a

9889
08:42:04 --> 08:42:05
<v MR. HOEVEN>huge difference.

9890
08:42:05 --> 08:42:05
<v MR. HOEVEN>Then we have the lasting

9891
08:42:05 --> 08:42:07
<v MR. HOEVEN>infrastructure.

9892
08:42:07 --> 08:42:08
<v MR. HOEVEN>We're meeting the lasting

9893
08:42:08 --> 08:42:08
<v MR. HOEVEN>infrastructure needs of this

9894
08:42:08 --> 08:42:11
<v MR. HOEVEN>country.

9895
08:42:11 --> 08:42:12
<v MR. HOEVEN>So with that, I would yield the

9896
08:42:12 --> 08:42:15
<v MR. HOEVEN>floor back.

9897
08:42:15 --> 08:42:17
<v MR. HOEVEN>Just a final comment, and that

9898
08:42:17 --> 08:42:19
<v MR. HOEVEN>is to ask that our colleagues

9899
08:42:20 --> 08:42:22
<v MR. HOEVEN>join us in this effort.

9900
08:42:22 --> 08:42:26
<v MR. HOEVEN>And if they have good ideas, we

9901
08:42:26 --> 08:42:27
<v MR. HOEVEN>are absolutely open to those

9902
08:42:27 --> 08:42:30
<v MR. HOEVEN>ideas.

9903
08:42:30 --> 08:42:31
<v MR. HOEVEN>But this is a concept whose time

9904
08:42:31 --> 08:42:34
<v MR. HOEVEN>has come.

9905
08:42:34 --> 08:42:36
<v MR. HOEVEN>And we need to make sure that as

9906
08:42:36 --> 08:42:38
<v MR. HOEVEN>we work forward on this highway

9907
08:42:38 --> 08:42:39
<v MR. HOEVEN>bill, we include the trips bonds

9908
08:42:39 --> 08:42:40
<v MR. HOEVEN>as part of that package.

9909
08:42:40 --> 08:42:43
<v MR. HOEVEN>with that, I yield the floor

9910
08:42:43 --> 08:42:44
<v MR. HOEVEN>back to my esteemed colleague.

9911
08:42:44 --> 08:42:44
<v MR. WYDEN>Mr. President, I

9912
08:42:44 --> 08:42:46
<v MR. WYDEN>ask unanimous consent to proceed

9913
08:42:46 --> 08:42:48
<v MR. WYDEN>for two additional minutes.

9914
08:42:48 --> 08:42:48
<v MR. WYDEN>I see our friend from iowa is

9915
08:42:48 --> 08:42:49
<v MR. WYDEN>here.

9916
08:42:49 --> 08:42:49
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

9917
08:42:49 --> 08:42:50
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

9918
08:42:50 --> 08:42:50
<v MR. WYDEN>thank you very

9919
08:42:50 --> 08:42:52
<v MR. WYDEN>much, Mr. President.

9920
08:42:52 --> 08:42:54
<v MR. WYDEN>I want to thank my colleague

9921
08:42:54 --> 08:42:54
<v MR. WYDEN>from north dakota from his

9922
08:42:54 --> 08:42:56
<v MR. WYDEN>statement.

9923
08:42:56 --> 08:42:59
<v MR. WYDEN>This is bipartisan.

9924
08:42:59 --> 08:43:01
<v MR. WYDEN>It is a bicameral effort.

9925
08:43:01 --> 08:43:03
<v MR. WYDEN>and my colleague's point at the

9926
08:43:03 --> 08:43:05
<v MR. WYDEN>end in terms of our being open

9927
08:43:05 --> 08:43:08
<v MR. WYDEN>to additional ideas and

9928
08:43:08 --> 08:43:09
<v MR. WYDEN>suggestions is particularly

9929
08:43:09 --> 08:43:10
<v MR. WYDEN>appropriate.

9930
08:43:10 --> 08:43:13
<v MR. WYDEN>What the challenge is going to

9931
08:43:13 --> 08:43:15
<v MR. WYDEN>be on this transportation issue

9932
08:43:15 --> 08:43:18
<v MR. WYDEN>for years to come is to try to

9933
08:43:18 --> 08:43:19
<v MR. WYDEN>find a way to generate the

9934
08:43:19 --> 08:43:22
<v MR. WYDEN>additional money for the work

9935
08:43:22 --> 08:43:24
<v MR. WYDEN>that needs to be done in a

9936
08:43:24 --> 08:43:25
<v MR. WYDEN>fashion that is acceptable to

9937
08:43:25 --> 08:43:28
<v MR. WYDEN>the american people.

9938
08:43:28 --> 08:43:29
<v MR. WYDEN>And if it was so easy,

9939
08:43:29 --> 08:43:30
<v MR. WYDEN>Mr. President, everybody would

9940
08:43:30 --> 08:43:32
<v MR. WYDEN>be just whipping through one

9941
08:43:32 --> 08:43:35
<v MR. WYDEN>idea after another.

9942
08:43:35 --> 08:43:37
<v MR. WYDEN>The two of us have spent many,

9943
08:43:37 --> 08:43:39
<v MR. WYDEN>many months trying to take the

9944
08:43:39 --> 08:43:41
<v MR. WYDEN>lessons that we've learned from

9945
08:43:41 --> 08:43:44
<v MR. WYDEN>the build america bonds effort

9946
08:43:44 --> 08:43:47
<v MR. WYDEN>and try to come up with a fresh

9947
08:43:47 --> 08:43:49
<v MR. WYDEN>approach, a fresh bipartisan

9948
08:43:49 --> 08:43:50
<v MR. WYDEN>approach that would be

9949
08:43:50 --> 08:43:51
<v MR. WYDEN>acceptable to colleagues on both

9950
08:43:51 --> 08:43:52
<v MR. WYDEN>sides of the aisle.

9951
08:43:52 --> 08:43:54
<v MR. WYDEN>We think we've done it.

9952
08:43:54 --> 08:43:54
<v MR. WYDEN>We don't think this is the only

9953
08:43:54 --> 08:43:57
<v MR. WYDEN>way.

9954
08:43:57 --> 08:43:59
<v MR. WYDEN>We're certainly open to ideas

9955
08:43:59 --> 08:44:02
<v MR. WYDEN>and suggestions, but the model

9956
08:44:03 --> 08:44:04
<v MR. WYDEN>of trying to focus on the states

9957
08:44:04 --> 08:44:06
<v MR. WYDEN>to build on the support that we

9958
08:44:06 --> 08:44:09
<v MR. WYDEN>have from the folks in the

9959
08:44:09 --> 08:44:12
<v MR. WYDEN>business and labor unions and a

9960
08:44:12 --> 08:44:14
<v MR. WYDEN>whole host of groups at the

9961
08:44:14 --> 08:44:16
<v MR. WYDEN>local level, mayors and county

9962
08:44:16 --> 08:44:16
<v MR. WYDEN>commissioners, strikes us as the

9963
08:44:16 --> 08:44:18
<v MR. WYDEN>way to go.

9964
08:44:18 --> 08:44:19
<v MR. WYDEN>But we're open to additional

9965
08:44:19 --> 08:44:22
<v MR. WYDEN>ideas and suggestions.

9966
08:44:22 --> 08:44:24
<v MR. WYDEN>our staffs will be working all

9967
08:44:24 --> 08:44:27
<v MR. WYDEN>through this week, the period of

9968
08:44:27 --> 08:44:29
<v MR. WYDEN>the President's day recess, to

9969
08:44:29 --> 08:44:31
<v MR. WYDEN>refine our proposal to deal with

9970
08:44:31 --> 08:44:32
<v MR. WYDEN>the various issues relating to

9971
08:44:32 --> 08:44:35
<v MR. WYDEN>scoring.

9972
08:44:35 --> 08:44:37
<v MR. WYDEN>But this is a genuinely new

9973
08:44:37 --> 08:44:38
<v MR. WYDEN>approach to generating revenue.

9974
08:44:38 --> 08:44:40
<v MR. WYDEN>It is bipartisan.

9975
08:44:41 --> 08:44:42
<v MR. WYDEN>It is bicameral with the support

9976
08:44:42 --> 08:44:44
<v MR. WYDEN>of folks in labor and business.

9977
08:44:44 --> 08:44:45
<v MR. WYDEN>And we hope that colleagues will

9978
08:44:45 --> 08:44:47
<v MR. WYDEN>be supportive.

9979
08:44:47 --> 08:44:49
<v MR. WYDEN>We're interested in their ideas

9980
08:44:49 --> 08:44:51
<v MR. WYDEN>and suggestions over this period

9981
08:44:51 --> 08:44:52
<v MR. WYDEN>between now and when we start

9982
08:44:52 --> 08:44:52
<v MR. WYDEN>voting on the transportation

9983
08:44:52 --> 08:44:54
<v MR. WYDEN>bill.

9984
08:44:54 --> 08:44:55
<v MR. WYDEN>So again I thank my friend from

9985
08:44:55 --> 08:44:57
<v MR. WYDEN>north dakota.

9986
08:44:57 --> 08:44:58
<v MR. WYDEN>It's been great to work with

9987
08:44:58 --> 08:45:02
<v MR. WYDEN>him.

9988
08:45:02 --> 08:45:03
<v MR. WYDEN>mr. President, I yield the

9989
08:45:03 --> 08:45:03
<v MR. WYDEN>floor.

9990
08:45:07 --> 08:45:07
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

9991
08:45:07 --> 08:45:11
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>leader.

9992
08:45:11 --> 08:45:12
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>The clerk will call the roll.

9993
08:46:44 --> 08:46:45
<v MR. REID>Mr. President.

9994
08:46:44 --> 08:46:45
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

9995
08:46:45 --> 08:46:46
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>majority leader.

<v MR. REID>I ask consent the

<v MR. REID>equal of the quorum be

9998

08:46:49 --> 08:46:50
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

10000
08:46:50 --> 08:46:51
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

10001
08:46:52 --> 08:46:53
<v MR. REID>I ask that a time

10002
08:46:53 --> 08:46:55
<v MR. REID>determined by the majority

<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>Without objection, so ordered.

10032

<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the senator from iowa.

10033
08:48:06 --> 08:48:11
<v MR. HARKIN>Mr. President, I've

10034
08:48:11 --> 08:48:14
<v MR. HARKIN>come to the floor today to state

10035
08:48:14 --> 08:48:16
<v MR. HARKIN>my vehement opposition to the

10036
08:48:16 --> 08:48:19
<v MR. HARKIN>agreement to extend the payroll

10037
08:48:19 --> 08:48:20
<v MR. HARKIN>tax cut and to slash the public

10038
08:48:20 --> 08:48:23
<v MR. HARKIN>health and prevention fund to

10039
08:48:23 --> 08:48:24
<v MR. HARKIN>help pay for the continuation of

10040
08:48:24 --> 08:48:26
<v MR. HARKIN>unemployment benefits.

10041
08:48:26 --> 08:48:28
<v MR. HARKIN>Let me preface my remarks by

10042
08:48:28 --> 08:48:29
<v MR. HARKIN>stressing the number one

10043
08:48:29 --> 08:48:30
<v MR. HARKIN>priority in washington today

10044
08:48:30 --> 08:48:33
<v MR. HARKIN>must be creating jobs, growing

10045
08:48:33 --> 08:48:34
<v MR. HARKIN>the economy and restoring the

10046
08:48:34 --> 08:48:36
<v MR. HARKIN>middle class.

10047
08:48:36 --> 08:48:38
<v MR. HARKIN>In recent months we have seen

10048
08:48:38 --> 08:48:38
<v MR. HARKIN>modestly good news on the jobs

10049
08:48:39 --> 08:48:40
<v MR. HARKIN>front, including the

10050
08:48:40 --> 08:48:41
<v MR. HARKIN>manufacturing sector, and we

10051
08:48:41 --> 08:48:42
<v MR. HARKIN>must do everything possible to

10052
08:48:42 --> 08:48:44
<v MR. HARKIN>keep our economy moving in the

10053
08:48:44 --> 08:48:47
<v MR. HARKIN>right direction.

10054
08:48:47 --> 08:48:48
<v MR. HARKIN>To this end, nothing is more

10055
08:48:48 --> 08:48:49
<v MR. HARKIN>effective than continuing

10056
08:48:49 --> 08:48:51
<v MR. HARKIN>unemployment insurance benefits

10057
08:48:51 --> 08:48:54
<v MR. HARKIN>for those hardest hit by the

10058
08:48:54 --> 08:48:55
<v MR. HARKIN>great recession.

10059
08:48:55 --> 08:48:56
<v MR. HARKIN>Details on the unemployment

10060
08:48:56 --> 08:48:58
<v MR. HARKIN>insurance portion of this

10061
08:48:58 --> 08:48:59
<v MR. HARKIN>agreement are not available,

10062
08:48:59 --> 08:49:01
<v MR. HARKIN>but what I am hearing sounds

10063
08:49:01 --> 08:49:04
<v MR. HARKIN>less and less like a good or

10064
08:49:04 --> 08:49:05
<v MR. HARKIN>fair deal for workers.

10065
08:49:05 --> 08:49:07
<v MR. HARKIN>federal unemployment benefits

10066
08:49:07 --> 08:49:08
<v MR. HARKIN>will be dramatically scaled back

10067
08:49:08 --> 08:49:10
<v MR. HARKIN>over the year, especially in

10068
08:49:10 --> 08:49:13
<v MR. HARKIN>iowa, my own state, and some

10069
08:49:13 --> 08:49:14
<v MR. HARKIN>other states in the midwest.

10070
08:49:15 --> 08:49:15
<v MR. HARKIN>I don't understand that,

10071
08:49:15 --> 08:49:17
<v MR. HARKIN>Mr. President.

10072
08:49:17 --> 08:49:18
<v MR. HARKIN>Seems to me, if you're

10073
08:49:18 --> 08:49:20
<v MR. HARKIN>unemployed, you're unemployed.

10074
08:49:20 --> 08:49:22
<v MR. HARKIN>If you're out of work and your

10075
08:49:22 --> 08:49:23
<v MR. HARKIN>family needs help, I don't care

10076
08:49:23 --> 08:49:24
<v MR. HARKIN>whether you live in iowa or

10077
08:49:24 --> 08:49:28
<v MR. HARKIN>minnesota or new york or new

10078
08:49:28 --> 08:49:31
<v MR. HARKIN>jersey or anywhere else.

10079
08:49:31 --> 08:49:32
<v MR. HARKIN>Now, the payroll tax provisions

10080
08:49:32 --> 08:49:34
<v MR. HARKIN>are also seriously flawed.

10081
08:49:34 --> 08:49:40
<v MR. HARKIN>This congress will be making a

10082
08:49:40 --> 08:49:42
<v MR. HARKIN>grave mistake, a grave mistake

10083
08:49:42 --> 08:49:45
<v MR. HARKIN>and reinforcing a dangerous

10084
08:49:45 --> 08:49:48
<v MR. HARKIN>precedent by extending the

10085
08:49:48 --> 08:49:50
<v MR. HARKIN>payroll tax cut and adding

10086
08:49:51 --> 08:49:54
<v MR. HARKIN>another negative without paying

10087
08:49:54 --> 08:49:57
<v MR. HARKIN>for it.

10088
08:49:57 --> 08:49:59
<v MR. HARKIN>And I'm dismayed that

10089
08:49:59 --> 08:50:01
<v MR. HARKIN>democrats, including a

10090
08:50:01 --> 08:50:03
<v MR. HARKIN>democratic President And a

10091
08:50:03 --> 08:50:04
<v MR. HARKIN>democratic vice President, have

10092
08:50:04 --> 08:50:08
<v MR. HARKIN>proposed this.

10093
08:50:08 --> 08:50:09
<v MR. HARKIN>and are willing to sign off on a

10094
08:50:09 --> 08:50:14
<v MR. HARKIN>deal that could begin the

10095
08:50:14 --> 08:50:16
<v MR. HARKIN>unraveling of social security.

10096
08:50:16 --> 08:50:17
<v MR. HARKIN>Two of the critical strengths of

10097
08:50:17 --> 08:50:21
<v MR. HARKIN>social security are that it is

10098
08:50:21 --> 08:50:23
<v MR. HARKIN>universal and it is self-funded.

10099
08:50:23 --> 08:50:27
<v MR. HARKIN>Not one dollar in benefits ever

10100
08:50:27 --> 08:50:29
<v MR. HARKIN>came from any source other than

10101
08:50:29 --> 08:50:32
<v MR. HARKIN>the payroll tax on future social

10102
08:50:32 --> 08:50:34
<v MR. HARKIN>security beneficiaries.

10103
08:50:34 --> 08:50:38
<v MR. HARKIN>Moreover, the program has never

10104
08:50:38 --> 08:50:40
<v MR. HARKIN>contributed even one dime to the

10105
08:50:40 --> 08:50:40
<v MR. HARKIN>deficits of the -- or the

10106
08:50:40 --> 08:50:43
<v MR. HARKIN>national debt.

10107
08:50:43 --> 08:50:45
<v MR. HARKIN>How often have we, those who

10108
08:50:45 --> 08:50:46
<v MR. HARKIN>support social security, in its

10109
08:50:46 --> 08:50:50
<v MR. HARKIN>entirety, how many times do we

10110
08:50:50 --> 08:50:53
<v MR. HARKIN>come to this floor and argue

10111
08:50:53 --> 08:50:54
<v MR. HARKIN>against those who would invade

10112
08:50:54 --> 08:50:56
<v MR. HARKIN>the social security and say,

10113
08:50:56 --> 08:50:57
<v MR. HARKIN>well, we got to reduce the

10114
08:50:57 --> 08:50:57
<v MR. HARKIN>deficit so we'll cut social

10115
08:50:57 --> 08:51:01
<v MR. HARKIN>security.

10116
08:51:01 --> 08:51:02
<v MR. HARKIN>And what do we say with all

10117
08:51:02 --> 08:51:05
<v MR. HARKIN>honesty?

10118
08:51:05 --> 08:51:07
<v MR. HARKIN>With all the evidence backing us

10119
08:51:07 --> 08:51:08
<v MR. HARKIN>up, social security has never

10120
08:51:08 --> 08:51:09
<v MR. HARKIN>contributed one dime to the

10121
08:51:09 --> 08:51:11
<v MR. HARKIN>deficit.

10122
08:51:11 --> 08:51:18
<v MR. HARKIN>So cutting social security will

10123
08:51:18 --> 08:51:22
<v MR. HARKIN>never reduce the deficit.

10124
08:51:22 --> 08:51:25
<v MR. HARKIN>Mr. President, with this bill

10125
08:51:25 --> 08:51:27
<v MR. HARKIN>we can no longer say that.

10126
08:51:27 --> 08:51:28
<v MR. HARKIN>we can no longer say that social

10127
08:51:28 --> 08:51:33
<v MR. HARKIN>security doesn't contribute to

10128
08:51:33 --> 08:51:37
<v MR. HARKIN>the deficit.

10129
08:51:37 --> 08:51:39
<v MR. HARKIN>This argument, this fact that

10130
08:51:39 --> 08:51:41
<v MR. HARKIN>social security has never

10131
08:51:41 --> 08:51:42
<v MR. HARKIN>contributed a dime to the

10132
08:51:42 --> 08:51:44
<v MR. HARKIN>deficit, has given social

10133
08:51:44 --> 08:51:47
<v MR. HARKIN>security a unique, even an

10134
08:51:47 --> 08:51:49
<v MR. HARKIN>almost a sacrosanct status in

10135
08:51:49 --> 08:51:51
<v MR. HARKIN>our society.

10136
08:51:51 --> 08:51:52
<v MR. HARKIN>It was one of the strongest

10137
08:51:52 --> 08:51:53
<v MR. HARKIN>arguments I repeat for those of

10138
08:51:53 --> 08:51:55
<v MR. HARKIN>us defending social security

10139
08:51:55 --> 08:51:56
<v MR. HARKIN>from misguided attempts to cut

10140
08:51:56 --> 08:52:03
<v MR. HARKIN>it in the name of deficit

10141
08:52:03 --> 08:52:04
<v MR. HARKIN>reduction.

10142
08:52:04 --> 08:52:05
<v MR. HARKIN>Mr. President, some might say,

10143
08:52:05 --> 08:52:08
<v MR. HARKIN>well, you know, people are out

10144
08:52:08 --> 08:52:10
<v MR. HARKIN>of work, the fragile economy,

10145
08:52:10 --> 08:52:11
<v MR. HARKIN>we need to put some spending in

10146
08:52:11 --> 08:52:12
<v MR. HARKIN>the pockets of our middle-class

10147
08:52:12 --> 08:52:14
<v MR. HARKIN>americans.

10148
08:52:14 --> 08:52:17
<v MR. HARKIN>I couldn't agree more.

10149
08:52:17 --> 08:52:18
<v MR. HARKIN>The biggest job creator in

10150
08:52:18 --> 08:52:20
<v MR. HARKIN>america is not someone who is

10151
08:52:20 --> 08:52:21
<v MR. HARKIN>rich and got billions of

10152
08:52:21 --> 08:52:23
<v MR. HARKIN>dollars.

10153
08:52:23 --> 08:52:25
<v MR. HARKIN>The biggest job creator in

10154
08:52:25 --> 08:52:26
<v MR. HARKIN>america is a working american

10155
08:52:26 --> 08:52:27
<v MR. HARKIN>with money in his or her pocket

10156
08:52:27 --> 08:52:29
<v MR. HARKIN>to spend.

10157
08:52:29 --> 08:52:31
<v MR. HARKIN>that's the biggest job creator.

10158
08:52:31 --> 08:52:33
<v MR. HARKIN>So yes, we have to get money in

10159
08:52:33 --> 08:52:34
<v MR. HARKIN>the pockets of working

10160
08:52:34 --> 08:52:36
<v MR. HARKIN>americans.

10161
08:52:36 --> 08:52:37
<v MR. HARKIN>And we have done that in the

10162
08:52:37 --> 08:52:40
<v MR. HARKIN>past.

10163
08:52:40 --> 08:52:43
<v MR. HARKIN>In a good way.

10164
08:52:43 --> 08:52:46
<v MR. HARKIN>In the 2009 recovery act,

10165
08:52:46 --> 08:52:50
<v MR. HARKIN>working americans received a

10166
08:52:50 --> 08:52:54
<v MR. HARKIN>6.2% credit of their taxes,

10167
08:52:54 --> 08:52:56
<v MR. HARKIN>refundable, up to $400 to

10168
08:52:56 --> 08:52:57
<v MR. HARKIN>increase their spending power

10169
08:52:57 --> 08:52:59
<v MR. HARKIN>and boost the economy.

10170
08:52:59 --> 08:52:59
<v MR. HARKIN>This in no way impacted the

10171
08:52:59 --> 08:53:03
<v MR. HARKIN>social security trust fund.

10172
08:53:03 --> 08:53:05
<v MR. HARKIN>I supported that wholeheartedly

10173
08:53:05 --> 08:53:08
<v MR. HARKIN>supported it.

10174
08:53:08 --> 08:53:11
<v MR. HARKIN>however, in late 2010,

10175
08:53:11 --> 08:53:15
<v MR. HARKIN>congress voted to replace that

10176
08:53:15 --> 08:53:18
<v MR. HARKIN>tax credit with a 2% reduction

10177
08:53:18 --> 08:53:19
<v MR. HARKIN>in payroll taxes which are

10178
08:53:19 --> 08:53:20
<v MR. HARKIN>dedicated to the social security

10179
08:53:20 --> 08:53:21
<v MR. HARKIN>trust fund.

10180
08:53:21 --> 08:53:25
<v MR. HARKIN>Now, this was done on a

10181
08:53:25 --> 08:53:27
<v MR. HARKIN>temporary basis to provide added

10182
08:53:27 --> 08:53:29
<v MR. HARKIN>income for working families and

10183
08:53:29 --> 08:53:30
<v MR. HARKIN>it was not offset.

10184
08:53:30 --> 08:53:34
<v MR. HARKIN>It was not paid for.

10185
08:53:34 --> 08:53:37
<v MR. HARKIN>So for the first time, for the

10186
08:53:37 --> 08:53:38
<v MR. HARKIN>first time general revenues were

10187
08:53:38 --> 08:53:40
<v MR. HARKIN>transferred to the social

10188
08:53:40 --> 08:53:44
<v MR. HARKIN>security trust fund to replace

10189
08:53:44 --> 08:53:48
<v MR. HARKIN>lost revenue.

10190
08:53:48 --> 08:53:50
<v MR. HARKIN>now, while this ensured that no

10191
08:53:50 --> 08:53:51
<v MR. HARKIN>financial harm was done to the

10192
08:53:51 --> 08:53:54
<v MR. HARKIN>trust fund itself, what it did

10193
08:53:54 --> 08:53:55
<v MR. HARKIN>was it created a dangerous

10194
08:53:55 --> 08:53:57
<v MR. HARKIN>precedent by calling into

10195
08:53:57 --> 08:53:59
<v MR. HARKIN>question social security's

10196
08:53:59 --> 08:54:05
<v MR. HARKIN>dedicated funding.

10197
08:54:05 --> 08:54:08
<v MR. HARKIN>I voted against that bill.

10198
08:54:08 --> 08:54:10
<v MR. HARKIN>Well, okay, so in late 2010 we

10199
08:54:10 --> 08:54:14
<v MR. HARKIN>transferred general revenues to

10200
08:54:14 --> 08:54:16
<v MR. HARKIN>replace lost revenue.

10201
08:54:16 --> 08:54:18
<v MR. HARKIN>Now in December of 2011, just a

10202
08:54:18 --> 08:54:20
<v MR. HARKIN>couple of months ago, we were

10203
08:54:20 --> 08:54:21
<v MR. HARKIN>persuaded to support the

10204
08:54:21 --> 08:54:23
<v MR. HARKIN>two-month extension of the

10205
08:54:23 --> 08:54:23
<v MR. HARKIN>payroll tax cut.

10206
08:54:23 --> 08:54:25
<v MR. HARKIN>And someone might look at the

10207
08:54:25 --> 08:54:26
<v MR. HARKIN>record and say harkin, you

10208
08:54:26 --> 08:54:28
<v MR. HARKIN>voted for that.

10209
08:54:28 --> 08:54:30
<v MR. HARKIN>I did with misgivings but a

10210
08:54:30 --> 08:54:33
<v MR. HARKIN>critical factor was it was at

10211
08:54:33 --> 08:54:34
<v MR. HARKIN>least fully paid for, and would

10212
08:54:34 --> 08:54:39
<v MR. HARKIN>not negatively impact the social

10213
08:54:39 --> 08:54:41
<v MR. HARKIN>security trust fund.

10214
08:54:41 --> 08:54:43
<v MR. HARKIN>Now, however, we're being

10215
08:54:43 --> 08:54:44
<v MR. HARKIN>offered an agreement that

10216
08:54:44 --> 08:54:46
<v MR. HARKIN>extends the payroll tax cut

10217
08:54:46 --> 08:54:47
<v MR. HARKIN>through the end of this calendar

10218
08:54:47 --> 08:54:48
<v MR. HARKIN>year.

10219
08:54:48 --> 08:54:49
<v MR. HARKIN>Bad enough.

10220
08:54:49 --> 08:54:52
<v MR. HARKIN>Doubly negative.

10221
08:54:52 --> 08:54:54
<v MR. HARKIN>doesn't pay for it.

10222
08:54:54 --> 08:54:55
<v MR. HARKIN>This is terrible public policy

10223
08:54:55 --> 08:54:57
<v MR. HARKIN>with grave consequences for

10224
08:54:57 --> 08:55:01
<v MR. HARKIN>social security.

10225
08:55:01 --> 08:55:02
<v MR. HARKIN>With this new agreement we'll be

10226
08:55:02 --> 08:55:04
<v MR. HARKIN>taking $100 billion from the

10227
08:55:04 --> 08:55:05
<v MR. HARKIN>general fund, which is in

10228
08:55:06 --> 08:55:09
<v MR. HARKIN>deficit, by the way, so we're

10229
08:55:09 --> 08:55:11
<v MR. HARKIN>going to add $100 billion to the

10230
08:55:11 --> 08:55:12
<v MR. HARKIN>deficit to substitute for the

10231
08:55:12 --> 08:55:15
<v MR. HARKIN>$100 billion in revenues lost

10232
08:55:15 --> 08:55:17
<v MR. HARKIN>due to the payroll tax cut.

10233
08:55:17 --> 08:55:19
<v MR. HARKIN>As I said and I repeat, we'll

10234
08:55:19 --> 08:55:23
<v MR. HARKIN>be adding $100 billion to the

10235
08:55:23 --> 08:55:24
<v MR. HARKIN>deficit and the debt.

10236
08:55:24 --> 08:55:27
<v MR. HARKIN>This compounds the mistake that

10237
08:55:27 --> 08:55:29
<v MR. HARKIN>congress made in late 2010 by

10238
08:55:29 --> 08:55:32
<v MR. HARKIN>passing the original payroll tax

10239
08:55:32 --> 08:55:36
<v MR. HARKIN>cut without paying for it.

10240
08:55:36 --> 08:55:37
<v MR. HARKIN>No longer, no longer can we say

10241
08:55:37 --> 08:55:38
<v MR. HARKIN>that social security is a

10242
08:55:38 --> 08:55:42
<v MR. HARKIN>program that pays for itself

10243
08:55:42 --> 08:55:45
<v MR. HARKIN>without adding to the deficits.

10244
08:55:45 --> 08:55:47
<v MR. HARKIN>Mixing general revenues into the

10245
08:55:47 --> 08:55:50
<v MR. HARKIN>system will make it easier for

10246
08:55:50 --> 08:55:51
<v MR. HARKIN>those who have long wished to

10247
08:55:51 --> 08:55:55
<v MR. HARKIN>dismantle social security to do

10248
08:55:55 --> 08:55:58
<v MR. HARKIN>so in the future.

10249
08:55:58 --> 08:56:00
<v MR. HARKIN>Worse, worse, since this tax

10250
08:56:00 --> 08:56:01
<v MR. HARKIN>cut is not being paid for,

10251
08:56:01 --> 08:56:03
<v MR. HARKIN>there's a much greater

10252
08:56:03 --> 08:56:04
<v MR. HARKIN>likelihood that it will be

10253
08:56:04 --> 08:56:06
<v MR. HARKIN>extended yet again in the

10254
08:56:06 --> 08:56:08
<v MR. HARKIN>future.

10255
08:56:08 --> 08:56:09
<v MR. HARKIN>Because you see, there's

10256
08:56:09 --> 08:56:11
<v MR. HARKIN>another precedent here.

10257
08:56:11 --> 08:56:12
<v MR. HARKIN>tax cuts don't have to be paid

10258
08:56:12 --> 08:56:14
<v MR. HARKIN>for.

10259
08:56:14 --> 08:56:14
<v MR. HARKIN>Only spending has to be paid

10260
08:56:14 --> 08:56:17
<v MR. HARKIN>for.

10261
08:56:17 --> 08:56:19
<v MR. HARKIN>Not tax cuts.

10262
08:56:19 --> 08:56:21
<v MR. HARKIN>Well, doesn't this open the door

10263
08:56:21 --> 08:56:22
<v MR. HARKIN>to even further extending

10264
08:56:22 --> 08:56:26
<v MR. HARKIN>payroll tax cuts because we

10265
08:56:26 --> 08:56:30
<v MR. HARKIN>don't have to pay for it?

10266
08:56:30 --> 08:56:32
<v MR. HARKIN>I choose my words carefully.

10267
08:56:32 --> 08:56:33
<v MR. HARKIN>make no mistake about it,

10268
08:56:33 --> 08:56:36
<v MR. HARKIN>american people, make no

10269
08:56:36 --> 08:56:39
<v MR. HARKIN>mistake about it, this is the

10270
08:56:39 --> 08:56:43
<v MR. HARKIN>beginning of the end of the

10271
08:56:43 --> 08:56:46
<v MR. HARKIN>sanctity of social security.

10272
08:56:46 --> 08:56:48
<v MR. HARKIN>The very real risk is that

10273
08:56:48 --> 08:56:50
<v MR. HARKIN>social security will become just

10274
08:56:50 --> 08:56:53
<v MR. HARKIN>another program to be paid for

10275
08:56:53 --> 08:56:56
<v MR. HARKIN>with deficit spending, and then

10276
08:56:56 --> 08:57:00
<v MR. HARKIN>in the future, perhaps raided

10277
08:57:00 --> 08:57:04
<v MR. HARKIN>to help reduce the deficit.

10278
08:57:04 --> 08:57:06
<v MR. HARKIN>I never thought -- I never

10279
08:57:06 --> 08:57:09
<v MR. HARKIN>thought I would live to see the

10280
08:57:09 --> 08:57:11
<v MR. HARKIN>day when a democratic president

10281
08:57:11 --> 08:57:13
<v MR. HARKIN>and a democratic vice President

10282
08:57:13 --> 08:57:15
<v MR. HARKIN>Would agree to put social

10283
08:57:15 --> 08:57:18
<v MR. HARKIN>security in this kind of

10284
08:57:18 --> 08:57:21
<v MR. HARKIN>jeopardy.

10285
08:57:21 --> 08:57:24
<v MR. HARKIN>Never did I ever imagine a

10286
08:57:24 --> 08:57:26
<v MR. HARKIN>democratic President Beginning

10287
08:57:26 --> 08:57:30
<v MR. HARKIN>the unraveling of social

10288
08:57:30 --> 08:57:33
<v MR. HARKIN>security.

10289
08:57:33 --> 08:57:36
<v MR. HARKIN>i warn my colleagues to consider

10290
08:57:36 --> 08:57:38
<v MR. HARKIN>the long-term ramifications of

10291
08:57:38 --> 08:57:40
<v MR. HARKIN>these actions.

10292
08:57:40 --> 08:57:41
<v MR. HARKIN>Now, while we need to maintain

10293
08:57:41 --> 08:57:43
<v MR. HARKIN>temporary supports for

10294
08:57:43 --> 08:57:46
<v MR. HARKIN>middle-class families, in these

10295
08:57:46 --> 08:57:48
<v MR. HARKIN>tough economic times, this

10296
08:57:48 --> 08:57:50
<v MR. HARKIN>assistance should not come at

10297
08:57:50 --> 08:57:53
<v MR. HARKIN>the expense of americans'

10298
08:57:53 --> 08:57:55
<v MR. HARKIN>retirement security.

10299
08:57:55 --> 08:57:57
<v MR. HARKIN>As traditional pensions have

10300
08:57:57 --> 08:58:02
<v MR. HARKIN>fallen by the wayside, as the

10301
08:58:02 --> 08:58:03
<v MR. HARKIN>value of people's retirements in

10302
08:58:03 --> 08:58:05
<v MR. HARKIN>401(K)'s have plummeted,

10303
08:58:05 --> 08:58:06
<v MR. HARKIN>social security remains the one

10304
08:58:06 --> 08:58:09
<v MR. HARKIN>essential program preventing

10305
08:58:09 --> 08:58:10
<v MR. HARKIN>millions of seniors from

10306
08:58:10 --> 08:58:14
<v MR. HARKIN>plunging into poverty in their

10307
08:58:14 --> 08:58:17
<v MR. HARKIN>retirement years.

10308
08:58:17 --> 08:58:19
<v MR. HARKIN>A program started by a

10309
08:58:19 --> 08:58:22
<v MR. HARKIN>democratic President And a

10310
08:58:22 --> 08:58:24
<v MR. HARKIN>democratic congress, further

10311
08:58:24 --> 08:58:28
<v MR. HARKIN>enhanced by future democratic

10312
08:58:28 --> 08:58:29
<v MR. HARKIN>presidents, others, truman,

10313
08:58:29 --> 08:58:33
<v MR. HARKIN>kennedy, lyndon johnson, of

10314
08:58:33 --> 08:58:34
<v MR. HARKIN>course, and the great society.

10315
08:58:34 --> 08:58:36
<v MR. HARKIN>This I believe has been the

10316
08:58:36 --> 08:58:38
<v MR. HARKIN>hallmark and the underpinning of

10317
08:58:38 --> 08:58:40
<v MR. HARKIN>the party that I've been proud

10318
08:58:40 --> 08:58:43
<v MR. HARKIN>to belong to.

10319
08:58:43 --> 08:58:46
<v MR. HARKIN>And now this party, this

10320
08:58:46 --> 08:58:51
<v MR. HARKIN>party, the democratic party,

10321
08:58:51 --> 08:58:52
<v MR. HARKIN>with a democratic President Is

10322
08:58:52 --> 08:58:54
<v MR. HARKIN>now beginning the unraveling of

10323
08:58:54 --> 08:58:56
<v MR. HARKIN>social security.

10324
08:58:56 --> 08:59:01
<v MR. HARKIN>That's what's happening, the

10325
08:59:01 --> 08:59:03
<v MR. HARKIN>unraveling of social security.

10326
08:59:03 --> 08:59:05
<v MR. HARKIN>Never again canny one of us come

10327
08:59:05 --> 08:59:07
<v MR. HARKIN>to the floor and say no, no,

10328
08:59:07 --> 08:59:08
<v MR. HARKIN>you can't cut social security to

10329
08:59:08 --> 08:59:10
<v MR. HARKIN>reduce the deficit because it

10330
08:59:10 --> 08:59:12
<v MR. HARKIN>doesn't add to the deficit.

10331
08:59:12 --> 08:59:14
<v MR. HARKIN>With this agreement, the social

10332
08:59:14 --> 08:59:19
<v MR. HARKIN>security will add to the deficit

10333
08:59:19 --> 08:59:22
<v MR. HARKIN>by $100 billion.

10334
08:59:22 --> 08:59:24
<v MR. HARKIN>Think about it.

10335
08:59:24 --> 08:59:26
<v MR. HARKIN>I urge my colleagues to look at

10336
08:59:26 --> 08:59:27
<v MR. HARKIN>excellent alternative ways of

10337
08:59:27 --> 08:59:29
<v MR. HARKIN>providing temporary support to

10338
08:59:29 --> 08:59:32
<v MR. HARKIN>our middle class.

10339
08:59:32 --> 08:59:34
<v MR. HARKIN>One proven approach would be to

10340
08:59:34 --> 08:59:35
<v MR. HARKIN>enlarge the making work pay tax

10341
08:59:35 --> 08:59:40
<v MR. HARKIN>credit that I talked about that

10342
08:59:40 --> 08:59:43
<v MR. HARKIN>was in the recovery act.

10343
08:59:43 --> 08:59:46
<v MR. HARKIN>Again, this tax credit put an

10344
08:59:46 --> 08:59:47
<v MR. HARKIN>aeducational $400 -- actually

10345
08:59:47 --> 08:59:50
<v MR. HARKIN>$800 in 2009 and 2010.

10346
08:59:50 --> 08:59:54
<v MR. HARKIN>It could be enlarged to provide

10347
08:59:54 --> 08:59:56
<v MR. HARKIN>the similar level of benefits to

10348
08:59:56 --> 08:59:58
<v MR. HARKIN>median -- median-income working

10349
08:59:58 --> 08:59:59
<v MR. HARKIN>families as compared to the

10350
08:59:59 --> 09:00:01
<v MR. HARKIN>payroll tax cuts.

10351
09:00:01 --> 09:00:03
<v MR. HARKIN>Instead of cutting the payroll

10352
09:00:03 --> 09:00:06
<v MR. HARKIN>tax, let's do the tax credit we

10353
09:00:06 --> 09:00:07
<v MR. HARKIN>had in 2009 and 2010, just bump

10354
09:00:07 --> 09:00:08
<v MR. HARKIN>it up a little bit.

10355
09:00:08 --> 09:00:09
<v MR. HARKIN>How do you pay for it?

10356
09:00:09 --> 09:00:12
<v MR. HARKIN>The same way we're paying for

10357
09:00:12 --> 09:00:13
<v MR. HARKIN>the cut in the social security

10358
09:00:13 --> 09:00:15
<v MR. HARKIN>taxes.

10359
09:00:15 --> 09:00:16
<v MR. HARKIN>put it in the deficit.

10360
09:00:16 --> 09:00:18
<v MR. HARKIN>Put it in the deficit.

10361
09:00:18 --> 09:00:24
<v MR. HARKIN>But at least you're not invading

10362
09:00:24 --> 09:00:27
<v MR. HARKIN>the social security trust fund.

10363
09:00:27 --> 09:00:28
<v MR. HARKIN>Cutting the payroll tax is a bad

10364
09:00:28 --> 09:00:30
<v MR. HARKIN>idea.

10365
09:00:30 --> 09:00:32
<v MR. HARKIN>Terrible idea.

10366
09:00:32 --> 09:00:34
<v MR. HARKIN>I'm embarrassed that it's being

10367
09:00:34 --> 09:00:35
<v MR. HARKIN>proposed by a democratic

10368
09:00:35 --> 09:00:42
<v MR. HARKIN>President And a democratic vice

10369
09:00:42 --> 09:00:47
<v MR. HARKIN>President.

10370
09:00:47 --> 09:00:49
<v MR. HARKIN>We could fully pay for a tax

10371
09:00:50 --> 09:00:52
<v MR. HARKIN>credit, a refundable tax

10372
09:00:52 --> 09:00:54
<v MR. HARKIN>credit, do it over a ten-year

10373
09:00:54 --> 09:00:56
<v MR. HARKIN>period of time so it doesn't

10374
09:00:56 --> 09:00:57
<v MR. HARKIN>negatively impact the fragile

10375
09:00:57 --> 09:01:00
<v MR. HARKIN>economic recovery.

10376
09:01:00 --> 09:01:01
<v MR. HARKIN>It would support middle-class

10377
09:01:01 --> 09:01:02
<v MR. HARKIN>families, the support they need

10378
09:01:02 --> 09:01:07
<v MR. HARKIN>and deserve, but it would not

10379
09:01:07 --> 09:01:08
<v MR. HARKIN>harm social security.

10380
09:01:08 --> 09:01:09
<v MR. HARKIN>Mr. President, I said there

10381
09:01:09 --> 09:01:10
<v MR. HARKIN>were a couple reasons I'm

10382
09:01:10 --> 09:01:12
<v MR. HARKIN>opposed to this.

10383
09:01:12 --> 09:01:14
<v MR. HARKIN>That's one.

10384
09:01:14 --> 09:01:17
<v MR. HARKIN>that's a big one.

10385
09:01:17 --> 09:01:17
<v MR. HARKIN>What we're doing to the social

10386
09:01:17 --> 09:01:20
<v MR. HARKIN>security trust fund.

10387
09:01:20 --> 09:01:22
<v MR. HARKIN>But I must also state my

10388
09:01:22 --> 09:01:24
<v MR. HARKIN>strenuous opposition to the cuts

10389
09:01:24 --> 09:01:25
<v MR. HARKIN>in this agreement to the public

10390
09:01:25 --> 09:01:27
<v MR. HARKIN>health and prevention fund

10391
09:01:27 --> 09:01:32
<v MR. HARKIN>that's in the affordable care

10392
09:01:32 --> 09:01:34
<v MR. HARKIN>act.

10393
09:01:34 --> 09:01:35
<v MR. HARKIN>Now, my republican friends and

10394
09:01:35 --> 09:01:38
<v MR. HARKIN>colleagues have been trying to

10395
09:01:38 --> 09:01:40
<v MR. HARKIN>get at the health care reform

10396
09:01:40 --> 09:01:41
<v MR. HARKIN>bill ever since we passed it,

10397
09:01:41 --> 09:01:43
<v MR. HARKIN>cut it here, nick it there.

10398
09:01:43 --> 09:01:46
<v MR. HARKIN>We've fought that off.

10399
09:01:46 --> 09:01:48
<v MR. HARKIN>And the health care act is now

10400
09:01:48 --> 09:01:49
<v MR. HARKIN>making a big impact in

10401
09:01:49 --> 09:01:51
<v MR. HARKIN>americans' lives.

10402
09:01:51 --> 09:01:52
<v MR. HARKIN>Need I mention the fact that

10403
09:01:52 --> 09:01:55
<v MR. HARKIN>kids are covered now even though

10404
09:01:55 --> 09:01:56
<v MR. HARKIN>they May have a preexisting

10405
09:01:56 --> 09:01:58
<v MR. HARKIN>condition.

10406
09:01:58 --> 09:02:01
<v MR. HARKIN>Young people can stay on their

10407
09:02:01 --> 09:02:04
<v MR. HARKIN>parents' policy until they're

10408
09:02:04 --> 09:02:06
<v MR. HARKIN>age 26.

10409
09:02:06 --> 09:02:08
<v MR. HARKIN>But we put into that affordable

10410
09:02:08 --> 09:02:13
<v MR. HARKIN>care act a prevention and public

10411
09:02:13 --> 09:02:14
<v MR. HARKIN>health fund with the aim of

10412
09:02:14 --> 09:02:16
<v MR. HARKIN>transforming america's sick care

10413
09:02:16 --> 09:02:18
<v MR. HARKIN>system into a true health care

10414
09:02:18 --> 09:02:19
<v MR. HARKIN>system.

10415
09:02:19 --> 09:02:20
<v MR. HARKIN>Emphasizing wellness and

10416
09:02:20 --> 09:02:21
<v MR. HARKIN>prevention and public health.

10417
09:02:21 --> 09:02:25
<v MR. HARKIN>Keeping people out of the

10418
09:02:25 --> 09:02:30
<v MR. HARKIN>hospital in the first place.

10419
09:02:30 --> 09:02:32
<v MR. HARKIN>So this last October things

10420
09:02:32 --> 09:02:32
<v MR. HARKIN>started kicking into effect.

10421
09:02:32 --> 09:02:36
<v MR. HARKIN>Beginning last October, for

10422
09:02:36 --> 09:02:38
<v MR. HARKIN>example, women over age 40 can

10423
09:02:38 --> 09:02:42
<v MR. HARKIN>get a mammogram every year with

10424
09:02:42 --> 09:02:42
<v MR. HARKIN>no co-pays, no deductibles, no

10425
09:02:42 --> 09:02:44
<v MR. HARKIN>cost.

10426
09:02:44 --> 09:02:44
<v MR. HARKIN>Has to be absorbed in the

10427
09:02:44 --> 09:02:48
<v MR. HARKIN>insurance program.

10428
09:02:48 --> 09:02:49
<v MR. HARKIN>Seniors on medicare get a free,

10429
09:02:49 --> 09:02:51
<v MR. HARKIN>every year, screening of their

10430
09:02:51 --> 09:02:52
<v MR. HARKIN>health and a health assessment

10431
09:02:52 --> 09:02:54
<v MR. HARKIN>so they know what to do in the

10432
09:02:54 --> 09:02:55
<v MR. HARKIN>future to keep themselves

10433
09:02:55 --> 09:03:00
<v MR. HARKIN>healthy.

10434
09:03:00 --> 09:03:03
<v MR. HARKIN>no co-pays, no deductibles.

10435
09:03:03 --> 09:03:05
<v MR. HARKIN>Colonoscopy, over age 50, no

10436
09:03:05 --> 09:03:07
<v MR. HARKIN>co-pays, no deductibles.

10437
09:03:07 --> 09:03:09
<v MR. HARKIN>And we also started investing in

10438
09:03:09 --> 09:03:13
<v MR. HARKIN>proven programs to promote

10439
09:03:13 --> 09:03:14
<v MR. HARKIN>health and wellness.

10440
09:03:14 --> 09:03:16
<v MR. HARKIN>Increasing -- decreasing

10441
09:03:16 --> 09:03:19
<v MR. HARKIN>obesity, for example, across the

10442
09:03:19 --> 09:03:21
<v MR. HARKIN>country through this fund.

10443
09:03:21 --> 09:03:22
<v MR. HARKIN>Earlier this month, the trust

10444
09:03:22 --> 09:03:24
<v MR. HARKIN>for america's health released a

10445
09:03:24 --> 09:03:27
<v MR. HARKIN>remarkable study showing that a

10446
09:03:27 --> 09:03:30
<v MR. HARKIN>5% reduction in the obesity rate

10447
09:03:30 --> 09:03:32
<v MR. HARKIN>could yield more than $00

10448
09:03:32 --> 09:03:35
<v MR. HARKIN>billion in savings on health

10449
09:03:35 --> 09:03:37
<v MR. HARKIN>care -- $600 billion in savings

10450
09:03:37 --> 09:03:37
<v MR. HARKIN>on health care in the last 20

10451
09:03:37 --> 09:03:39
<v MR. HARKIN>years.

10452
09:03:39 --> 09:03:40
<v MR. HARKIN>This study is the latest on what

10453
09:03:40 --> 09:03:41
<v MR. HARKIN>commonsense tells us, prevention

10454
09:03:41 --> 09:03:44
<v MR. HARKIN>is the best medicine, both for

10455
09:03:44 --> 09:03:48
<v MR. HARKIN>our bodies and for our budgets.

10456
09:03:48 --> 09:03:50
<v MR. HARKIN>Now, think about it.

10457
09:03:50 --> 09:03:52
<v MR. HARKIN>We currently spend more than

10458
09:03:52 --> 09:03:53
<v MR. HARKIN>$2 trillion on health care each

10459
09:03:53 --> 09:03:56
<v MR. HARKIN>year.

10460
09:03:56 --> 09:03:58
<v MR. HARKIN>Estimated 75% of that is

10461
09:03:58 --> 09:04:01
<v MR. HARKIN>accounted for by preventable

10462
09:04:01 --> 09:04:03
<v MR. HARKIN>chronic diseases and conditions.

10463
09:04:03 --> 09:04:06
<v MR. HARKIN>Chronic disease is a prime

10464
09:04:06 --> 09:04:08
<v MR. HARKIN>culprit in the relentless rise

10465
09:04:08 --> 09:04:10
<v MR. HARKIN>in health insurance premiums.

10466
09:04:10 --> 09:04:12
<v MR. HARKIN>It contributes to the overall

10467
09:04:12 --> 09:04:13
<v MR. HARKIN>poor health, places our nation's

10468
09:04:13 --> 09:04:15
<v MR. HARKIN>economic security and

10469
09:04:15 --> 09:04:18
<v MR. HARKIN>competitiveness in jeopardy.

10470
09:04:18 --> 09:04:19
<v MR. HARKIN>this is shameful and, frankly,

10471
09:04:19 --> 09:04:21
<v MR. HARKIN>exasperating, because we know

10472
09:04:21 --> 09:04:23
<v MR. HARKIN>how to prevent many of these

10473
09:04:23 --> 09:04:25
<v MR. HARKIN>diseases and conditions from

10474
09:04:25 --> 09:04:27
<v MR. HARKIN>developing in the first place.

10475
09:04:27 --> 09:04:28
<v MR. HARKIN>We know a lot about the power of

10476
09:04:28 --> 09:04:30
<v MR. HARKIN>prevention through the kinds of

10477
09:04:30 --> 09:04:33
<v MR. HARKIN>evidence-based clinical and

10478
09:04:33 --> 09:04:35
<v MR. HARKIN>community prevention programs,

10479
09:04:35 --> 09:04:36
<v MR. HARKIN>things that are funded by the

10480
09:04:36 --> 09:04:36
<v MR. HARKIN>prevention and public health

10481
09:04:36 --> 09:04:38
<v MR. HARKIN>fund.

10482
09:04:38 --> 09:04:40
<v MR. HARKIN>for example, for every $1 we

10483
09:04:40 --> 09:04:45
<v MR. HARKIN>spend on the full course of

10484
09:04:45 --> 09:04:47
<v MR. HARKIN>childhood vaccines, we can save

10485
09:04:47 --> 09:04:47
<v MR. HARKIN>$16.60 in future health care

10486
09:04:47 --> 09:04:49
<v MR. HARKIN>costs.

10487
09:04:49 --> 09:04:51
<v MR. HARKIN>Not a bad return on a dollar,

10488
09:04:51 --> 09:04:53
<v MR. HARKIN>not to mention the quality of

10489
09:04:53 --> 09:04:55
<v MR. HARKIN>lives of kids who don't get

10490
09:04:55 --> 09:04:57
<v MR. HARKIN>measles and mumps and rubella

10491
09:04:57 --> 09:04:59
<v MR. HARKIN>and a whole bunch of other

10492
09:04:59 --> 09:05:00
<v MR. HARKIN>things, and polio.

10493
09:05:00 --> 09:05:01
<v MR. HARKIN>Given the relentless rise in

10494
09:05:01 --> 09:05:05
<v MR. HARKIN>health care costs, a classic

10495
09:05:05 --> 09:05:06
<v MR. HARKIN>case of penny-wise,

10496
09:05:06 --> 09:05:09
<v MR. HARKIN>pound-foolish to take money from

10497
09:05:09 --> 09:05:14
<v MR. HARKIN>the prevention and public health

10498
09:05:14 --> 09:05:15
<v MR. HARKIN>fund.

10499
09:05:15 --> 09:05:16
<v MR. HARKIN>You know, americans get it,

10500
09:05:16 --> 09:05:17
<v MR. HARKIN>Mr. President.

10501
09:05:17 --> 09:05:19
<v MR. HARKIN>Americans get it when it comes

10502
09:05:19 --> 09:05:20
<v MR. HARKIN>to disease prevention.

10503
09:05:20 --> 09:05:24
<v MR. HARKIN>They understand that prevention

10504
09:05:24 --> 09:05:25
<v MR. HARKIN>saves lives, saves money, is the

10505
09:05:25 --> 09:05:30
<v MR. HARKIN>commonsense thing to do.

10506
09:05:30 --> 09:05:31
<v MR. HARKIN>In this bill -- again, first

10507
09:05:31 --> 09:05:33
<v MR. HARKIN>time -- $5 billion is taken out

10508
09:05:33 --> 09:05:35
<v MR. HARKIN>of the prevention and public

10509
09:05:35 --> 09:05:38
<v MR. HARKIN>health fund.

10510
09:05:38 --> 09:05:39
<v MR. HARKIN>$5 billion.

10511
09:05:39 --> 09:05:40
<v MR. HARKIN>this is outrageous and

10512
09:05:40 --> 09:05:43
<v MR. HARKIN>unacceptable.

10513
09:05:43 --> 09:05:45
<v MR. HARKIN>Now, I have said that americans

10514
09:05:45 --> 09:05:46
<v MR. HARKIN>get it.

10515
09:05:46 --> 09:05:48
<v MR. HARKIN>Here's a letter from the

10516
09:05:48 --> 09:05:53
<v MR. HARKIN>american college of preventive

10517
09:05:53 --> 09:05:55
<v MR. HARKIN>medicine urging us to oppose

10518
09:05:55 --> 09:05:57
<v MR. HARKIN>taking any money, to divert any

10519
09:05:57 --> 09:05:58
<v MR. HARKIN>money from the public health --

10520
09:05:58 --> 09:06:00

09:06:15 --> 09:06:18
<v MR. HARKIN>money from that fund.

<v MR. HARKIN>fund.

10534
09:06:23 --> 09:06:24

10535
09:06:24 --> 09:06:25
<v MR. HARKIN>to taking money from the

<v MR. HARKIN>this fund.

10541
09:06:36 --> 09:06:37
<v MR. HARKIN>The prevention institute opposed

09:06:37 --> 09:06:42
<v MR. HARKIN>to taking money from the

09:06:42 --> 09:06:45

<v MR. HARKIN>state and territorial aids

10547
09:06:50 --> 09:06:53
<v MR. HARKIN>directors, it is american

10548
09:06:53 --> 09:06:53
<v MR. HARKIN>-- the american public

09:06:53 --> 09:06:54

<v MR. HARKIN>prevention and public health.

10563
09:07:27 --> 09:07:29
<v MR. HARKIN>And I ask consent that those

10564
09:07:29 --> 09:07:31
<v MR. HARKIN>letters and that listing of

10565
09:07:31 --> 09:07:33
<v MR. HARKIN>those groups be placed at the

10566
09:07:33 --> 09:07:34
<v MR. HARKIN>end of my remarks in the record.

10567
09:07:35 --> 09:07:36
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without without

10568
09:07:36 --> 09:07:37
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

10569
09:07:38 --> 09:07:38
<v MR. HARKIN>so who do we listen

10570
09:07:38 --> 09:07:40
<v MR. HARKIN>to?

10571
09:07:40 --> 09:07:41
<v MR. HARKIN>Do we listen to public health

10572
09:07:41 --> 09:07:42
<v MR. HARKIN>officials?

10573
09:07:42 --> 09:07:44
<v MR. HARKIN>The american heart association,

10574
09:07:44 --> 09:07:46
<v MR. HARKIN>the american lung association?

10575
09:07:46 --> 09:07:50
<v MR. HARKIN>People all across america saying

10576
09:07:50 --> 09:07:51
<v MR. HARKIN>don't do this.

10577
09:07:51 --> 09:07:53
<v MR. HARKIN>This is what's going to save us

10578
09:07:53 --> 09:07:54
<v MR. HARKIN>in the future.

10579
09:07:54 --> 09:07:58
<v MR. HARKIN>They're taking $5 billion out of

10580
09:07:58 --> 09:08:00
<v MR. HARKIN>it.

10581
09:08:00 --> 09:08:01
<v MR. HARKIN>It's totally unacceptable and

10582
09:08:01 --> 09:08:04
<v MR. HARKIN>it's outrageous.

10583
09:08:04 --> 09:08:05
<v MR. HARKIN>Outrageous.

10584
09:08:05 --> 09:08:07
<v MR. HARKIN>Outrageous.

10585
09:08:07 --> 09:08:08
<v MR. HARKIN>And, again, this wasn't in

10586
09:08:08 --> 09:08:10
<v MR. HARKIN>either the house or the senate

10587
09:08:10 --> 09:08:12
<v MR. HARKIN>bill.

10588
09:08:12 --> 09:08:13
<v MR. HARKIN>If I'm not mistaken, maybe a

10589
09:08:13 --> 09:08:14
<v MR. HARKIN>point of order lies against

10590
09:08:14 --> 09:08:15
<v MR. HARKIN>things put in a conference

10591
09:08:15 --> 09:08:16
<v MR. HARKIN>report that were not considered

10592
09:08:16 --> 09:08:19
<v MR. HARKIN>in either the house or the

10593
09:08:19 --> 09:08:21
<v MR. HARKIN>senate.

10594
09:08:21 --> 09:08:23
<v MR. HARKIN>Well, this agreement is being

10595
09:08:23 --> 09:08:25
<v MR. HARKIN>presented as a done deal,

10596
09:08:25 --> 09:08:27
<v MR. HARKIN>nothing we can do about it.

10597
09:08:27 --> 09:08:30
<v MR. HARKIN>Well, I urge senators to think

10598
09:08:30 --> 09:08:32
<v MR. HARKIN>about the dangerous consequences

10599
09:08:32 --> 09:08:34
<v MR. HARKIN>and precedence of passing this

10600
09:08:34 --> 09:08:37
<v MR. HARKIN>bill in its current form.

10601
09:08:37 --> 09:08:38
<v MR. HARKIN>This bill ends social security's

10602
09:08:38 --> 09:08:40
<v MR. HARKIN>historic status as a program

10603
09:08:40 --> 09:08:42
<v MR. HARKIN>that pays for itself.

10604
09:08:42 --> 09:08:45
<v MR. HARKIN>think about it.

10605
09:08:45 --> 09:08:47
<v MR. HARKIN>The bill validates the absurd

10606
09:08:47 --> 09:08:51
<v MR. HARKIN>idea that tax cuts have a

10607
09:08:51 --> 09:08:53
<v MR. HARKIN>special status, they don't need

10608
09:08:53 --> 09:08:56
<v MR. HARKIN>to be offset, but spending does.

10609
09:08:56 --> 09:08:58
<v MR. HARKIN>Think about it.

10610
09:08:58 --> 09:09:00
<v MR. HARKIN>And this bill foolishly slashes

10611
09:09:00 --> 09:09:03
<v MR. HARKIN>funding for the prevention and

10612
09:09:03 --> 09:09:05
<v MR. HARKIN>public health fund, cuts that

10613
09:09:05 --> 09:09:09
<v MR. HARKIN>will significantly add to the

10614
09:09:09 --> 09:09:12
<v MR. HARKIN>deficit in future years.

10615
09:09:12 --> 09:09:14
<v MR. HARKIN>Again, I repeat, we need to

10616
09:09:14 --> 09:09:15
<v MR. HARKIN>continue to bolster the economy,

10617
09:09:15 --> 09:09:18
<v MR. HARKIN>boost the income of ordinary

10618
09:09:18 --> 09:09:19
<v MR. HARKIN>americans.

10619
09:09:19 --> 09:09:20
<v MR. HARKIN>This bill is not the way to do

10620
09:09:20 --> 09:09:21
<v MR. HARKIN>it.

10621
09:09:21 --> 09:09:23
<v MR. HARKIN>It's a devil's deal.

10622
09:09:23 --> 09:09:24
<v MR. HARKIN>it's a bad deal.

10623
09:09:24 --> 09:09:26
<v MR. HARKIN>There are better ways to

10624
09:09:26 --> 09:09:27
<v MR. HARKIN>accomplish these goals.

10625
09:09:27 --> 09:09:31
<v MR. HARKIN>I urge my colleagues to vote

10626
09:09:31 --> 09:09:32
<v MR. HARKIN>against this misguided, terribly

10627
09:09:32 --> 09:09:34
<v MR. HARKIN>misguided bill in its current

10628
09:09:34 --> 09:09:34

09:09:34 --> 09:09:44
<v MR. HARKIN>Mr. President, I yield the floor

10630
09:09:44 --> 09:09:45

10631
09:09:45 --> 09:09:45
<v MR. HARKIN>I suggest the absence of a

10632
09:09:45 --> 09:09:46

<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the clerk

10634
09:09:50 --> 09:09:51
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>will call the roll.

10635
09:55:09 --> 09:55:10
<v MR. REID>I ask consent the call

<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

10638
09:55:11 --> 09:55:12
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

10639
09:55:12 --> 09:55:14
<v MR. REID>I ask consent that we

10640
09:55:14 --> 09:55:15
<v MR. REID>proceed to a period of morning

10641
09:55:15 --> 09:55:16

<v MR. REID>each.

10644
09:55:17 --> 09:55:17
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

10645
09:55:17 --> 09:55:18
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

10646
09:55:19 --> 09:55:20
<v MR. REID>I understand there's a

10647
09:55:20 --> 09:55:22
<v MR. REID>bill at the desk due for its

10648
09:55:22 --> 09:55:23
<v MR. REID>first reading.

10649
09:55:23 --> 09:55:24
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the clerk

10650
09:55:24 --> 09:55:26
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>will read the title of the bill

10651
09:55:26 --> 09:55:29
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>for the first time.

10652
09:55:29 --> 09:55:32
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>The clerk: s. 2118, a bill to

10653
09:55:32 --> 09:55:33
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>remove unelected, unaccountable

10654
09:55:33 --> 09:55:34
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>bureaucrats from seniors'

10655
09:55:34 --> 09:55:35
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>personal health decisions by

09:55:35 --> 09:55:37
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>repealing the independent

10657
09:55:37 --> 09:55:38
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>payment advisory board.

10658
09:55:39 --> 09:55:40
<v MR. REID>I ask for its second

10659
09:55:40 --> 09:55:41
<v MR. REID>reading, Mr. President.

10660
09:55:41 --> 09:55:43
<v MR. REID>In order the place the bill on

10661
09:55:43 --> 09:55:44
<v MR. REID>the calendar, but I object to my

10662
09:55:44 --> 09:55:45
<v MR. REID>own request.

10663
09:55:45 --> 09:55:50
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection

10664
09:55:50 --> 09:55:52
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>having been heard, the bill will

10665
09:55:52 --> 09:55:53
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>receive its second reading on

10666
09:55:54 --> 09:55:54
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the next legislative day.

10667
09:55:56 --> 09:55:59
<v MR. REID>Mr. President, I

10668
09:55:59 --> 09:56:01
<v MR. REID>apologize for everyone having to

10669
09:56:01 --> 09:56:03
<v MR. REID>wait, all the staff, but we have

10670
09:56:03 --> 09:56:05
<v MR. REID>things we've been working on and

10671
09:56:05 --> 09:56:07
<v MR. REID>we've made a lot of headway.

10672
09:56:07 --> 09:56:09
<v MR. REID>a lot of progress.

10673
09:56:09 --> 09:56:11
<v MR. REID>We're still not all the way

10674
09:56:11 --> 09:56:12
<v MR. REID>there but it appears to me that

10675
09:56:12 --> 09:56:13
<v MR. REID>the house will probably vote on

10676
09:56:13 --> 09:56:15
<v MR. REID>the conference report sometime

10677
09:56:15 --> 09:56:17
<v MR. REID>tomorrow morning.

10678
09:56:17 --> 09:56:18
<v MR. REID>And that being the case, we'll

10679
09:56:18 --> 09:56:19
<v MR. REID>see what we can do to expedite

10680
09:56:19 --> 09:56:20
<v MR. REID>things here.

10681
09:56:20 --> 09:56:23
<v MR. REID>I will -- I have the authority

10682
09:56:23 --> 09:56:27
<v MR. REID>now to have the vote on the

10683
09:56:27 --> 09:56:28
<v MR. REID>judge and the cloture vote so we

10684
09:56:28 --> 09:56:29
<v MR. REID>can do that at any time tomorrow

10685
09:56:29 --> 09:56:30
<v MR. REID>tomorrow.

10686
09:56:30 --> 09:56:31
<v MR. REID>I'll notify the republican

10687
09:56:31 --> 09:56:33
<v MR. REID>leader, make sure it's

10688
09:56:33 --> 09:56:35
<v MR. REID>convenient for everyone.

10689
09:56:35 --> 09:56:36
<v MR. REID>We're going to come in at 10:00

10690
09:56:36 --> 09:56:39
<v MR. REID>tomorrow morning.

10691
09:56:39 --> 09:56:41
<v MR. REID>So I ask consent, Mr. President,

10692
09:56:41 --> 09:56:43
<v MR. REID>that we come in at 10:00

10693
09:56:43 --> 09:56:44
<v MR. REID>tomorrow, February 17.

10694
09:56:44 --> 09:56:44
<v MR. REID>Following the prayer and the

10695
09:56:44 --> 09:56:46
<v MR. REID>pledge, the journal of

10696
09:56:46 --> 09:56:47
<v MR. REID>proceedings be approved to date,

10697
09:56:47 --> 09:56:48
<v MR. REID>the morning hour be deemed

10698
09:56:48 --> 09:56:50
<v MR. REID>expired, the time for the two

10699
09:56:50 --> 09:56:51
<v MR. REID>leaders be reserved for their

10700
09:56:51 --> 09:56:52
<v MR. REID>use later in the day.

10701
09:56:52 --> 09:56:53
<v MR. REID>Following any leader remarks,

10702
09:56:53 --> 09:56:55
<v MR. REID>the senate be in a period of

10703
09:56:56 --> 09:56:56
<v MR. REID>morning business until 11:00

10704
09:56:56 --> 09:56:58
<v MR. REID>with senators permitted to speak

10705
09:56:58 --> 09:56:59
<v MR. REID>for up to ten minutes each, with

10706
09:56:59 --> 09:57:00
<v MR. REID>the time equally divided or

10707
09:57:00 --> 09:57:01
<v MR. REID>controlled between the two

10708
09:57:01 --> 09:57:02
<v MR. REID>leaders their designees, with

10709
09:57:02 --> 09:57:03
<v MR. REID>the republicans controlling the

10710
09:57:03 --> 09:57:04
<v MR. REID>first half, the majority

10711
09:57:04 --> 09:57:05
<v MR. REID>controlling the final half.

10712
09:57:05 --> 09:57:06
<v MR. REID>Following morning business, the

10713
09:57:06 --> 09:57:08
<v MR. REID>senate resume consideration of

10714
09:57:08 --> 09:57:10
<v MR. REID>s. 1813.

10715
09:57:10 --> 09:57:12
<v MR. REID>And I ask that second-degree

10716
09:57:12 --> 09:57:13
<v MR. REID>amendment deadline be at 10:30

10717
09:57:13 --> 09:57:14
<v MR. REID>A.M. Tomorrow morning on that

10718
09:57:14 --> 09:57:14
<v MR. REID>legislation.

10719
09:57:14 --> 09:57:15
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>without

10720
09:57:15 --> 09:57:15
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>objection.

10721
09:57:15 --> 09:57:18
<v MR. REID>so, Mr. President

10722
09:57:18 --> 09:57:20
<v MR. REID>there, could be up to four votes

10723
09:57:20 --> 09:57:22
<v MR. REID>tomorrow.

10724
09:57:22 --> 09:57:23
<v MR. REID>If things don't work out, we'd

10725
09:57:23 --> 09:57:24
<v MR. REID>have to have some of the votes

10726
09:57:24 --> 09:57:26
<v MR. REID>later in the week.

10727
09:57:26 --> 09:57:27
<v MR. REID>So we hope that can come to be.

10728
09:57:27 --> 09:57:29
<v MR. REID>we'll notify senators the minute

10729
09:57:29 --> 09:57:32
<v MR. REID>we have some way of moving

10730
09:57:32 --> 09:57:33
<v MR. REID>forward with everything.

10731
09:57:33 --> 09:57:37
<v MR. REID>The four votes would be, of

10732
09:57:37 --> 09:57:41
<v MR. REID>course, the cloture vote on the

10733
09:57:41 --> 09:57:43
<v MR. REID>highway bill, furman nomination

10734
09:57:43 --> 09:57:44
<v MR. REID>nomination -- we might have to

10735
09:57:44 --> 09:57:46
<v MR. REID>do cloture on the conference

10736
09:57:46 --> 09:57:46
<v MR. REID>report, and final passage of

10737
09:57:46 --> 09:57:48
<v MR. REID>that.

10738
09:57:48 --> 09:57:49
<v MR. REID>so we'll notify everyone what

10739
09:57:49 --> 09:57:49
<v MR. REID>agreements we've been able to

10740
09:57:49 --> 09:57:50
<v MR. REID>work out.

10741
09:57:50 --> 09:57:52
<v MR. REID>I've been in touch with the

10742
09:57:52 --> 09:57:54
<v MR. REID>republican leader and hopefully

10743
09:57:54 --> 09:57:56
<v MR. REID>we can move forward fairly

10744
09:57:56 --> 09:57:57
<v MR. REID>quickly tomorrow morning.

10745
09:57:57 --> 09:57:59
<v MR. REID>So senators should expect a

10746
09:57:59 --> 09:58:01
<v MR. REID>series of roll call votes

10747
09:58:01 --> 09:58:02
<v MR. REID>tomorrow on the motion to invoke

10748
09:58:02 --> 09:58:04
<v MR. REID>cloture on the reid amendment,

10749
09:58:04 --> 09:58:05
<v MR. REID>and on confirmation of furman

10750
09:58:05 --> 09:58:09
<v MR. REID>nomination.

10751
09:58:09 --> 09:58:11
<v MR. REID>as I indicated, we also hope to

10752
09:58:11 --> 09:58:14
<v MR. REID>consider the payroll conference

10753
09:58:14 --> 09:58:15
<v MR. REID>report.

10754
09:58:15 --> 09:58:18
<v MR. REID>If there's no further business

10755
09:58:18 --> 09:58:19
<v MR. REID>to come before the senate I, --

10756
09:58:19 --> 09:58:20
<v MR. REID>the senate, I ask we adjourn

10757
09:58:20 --> 09:58:21
<v MR. REID>under the previous order.

10758
09:58:21 --> 09:58:22
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>the

10759
09:58:22 --> 09:58:27
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>senate stands adjourned until

10760
09:58:27 --> 09:58:27
<v THE PRESIDING OFFICER>10:00 A.M. Tomorrow morning.
